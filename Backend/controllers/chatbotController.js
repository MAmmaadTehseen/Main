      "Project: Cost Optimization In Weighted Graphs\nAdvisor: Dr. Malik Shahzad Awan\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: An application with improved algorithms for handheld devices by modifying existing  algorithms according to required scenario in which different parameters changes the weight  according to environment.   Weighted graph having weight at edges and vertices and this weight changes continuously  according to continuous change in environment, to find optimal path in this condition is a  difficult problem. By modifying the existing graph in such a way that it resolves this problem  in an optimal way. It gives the path that has minimum traffic load and other road hurdles and  have minimum distance from our current location to our destination resulting in optimality in  time.   Implementation of the above algorithm results in an application that gives the best suggested  path avoiding traffic jams and hurdles before departing and at any point of journey. It also  reduce the effort to call others to know where they are, you can just know their location on  map and their estimated time to reach destination. It may also advise and remind you when to  leave, to reach your destination in time.     Tools: JAVA. SPSS.",

      "Project: Automatic document Clustering:\nAdvisor: Imran Shafique\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: Clustering   is   a   technique   to   help   divide   particular   documents   into    clusters (categories) using different algorithms. Documents in on cluster should be similar  to the other documents in same cluster whereas dissimilar to the documents in other  clusters. This will help us analyze the trends in documents. This is a technique for  similarity measurement which can be used differently in different fields like, checking the  plagiarism among assignment  documents.  Therefore  we  aim  to  keep  our  tool   \u201cAutomatic  Document Clustering\u201d general, which can be used for multiple purposes  (similarity check for research or for plagiarism detection.  The target is to develop a software from scratch so that we can exercise what we  have learned in out BSCS course. This project will give us confidence and knowledge from  software development point of view. We are focusing on building a tool that is simple and  is easily available for everyone. Our tool will be doing automatic clustering using the above  proposed algorithm; our implementation will work well with text files however files with  symbols and numbers will also be entertained but these numbers will be considered as text  data. Our aim is to provide such technique which will be beneficial and efficient for  the users of different domain.    59",

KAMRAN SHABBIR\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: It is very difficult for some disable or old people and others sleeping at night to wake up and move all  over in the house to shutoff lights, doors and windows etc. So, our goal will be to control this whole  home system along with providing security services using the mobile application. Although such  applications have been introduced worldwide but there is not such an app which is collectively  controlling all the things. Our goal is to combine all these apps and merge them into a single app which  will provide security and surveillance including all other home automation safety features. Home  automation system represent the front-end of smart grids, where the energy monitoring and control    121    operations are enabled through smart devices installed in households and residential buildings. There  are many home automation technologies available in the market, and users are left to select their  choice of best technology. X, Z-Wave, ZigBee, INSTEON and EnOcean are the home automation  technologies compared in this paper.",

If patient get the CT scan done, then he/she has to wait for a long time to get the report. It is due to the  shortage of radiologist and pathologists in government sector. Brain tumor and clots are common  situations and become deadly if not diagnosed in time or treated well. MRI and CT scans are used for    130    detection of such conditions. Human error is another issue that is effecting efficiency of this system.  Keeping in view this problem, this research proposes a system that will be able to gather scanned  images form a central system that will be updated by the nodes present at different geographical  locations. System automates the process of determining if there is any clot or a tumor present in the  brain. It will be capable of computing size and location of the tumor. For this purpose, Machine  Learning will be used. Datasets will be developed and to create classifiers. CPU processing capabilities  are limited; it cannot handle huge amount of requests from dozens of centers. In this regard, a  heterogeneous parallel computing will be performed using NVIDIA GPU. It will help to speed up the  process. Web portal will be developed and initially XAMPP will be serve the purpose of host. It will  help to test the system at single node. Database will be also being managed for report history and it  will provide search option with queries like patient, disease, date, location etc.  After evaluation of the  prototype it will be shared with INMOL Hospital for commercial testing. If found capable, it will be  donated to government institutions.",

SAEED IQBAL\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: 131        This application detects and notifies about certain human actions (sleeping, running, eating etc.) using  real time object detection and deep learning technique.  Joseph et al. proposed that humans glance at an image and instantly know what objects are in the  image, where they are, and how they interact. Current detection systems repurpose classifiers to  perform detection. YOLO a new approach to object detection. It outperforms other methods such as R- CNN and DPM. The base model processes images 45 frames per second and fast YOLO processes at  155 frames per second.  How the Detection does really happens??   Recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal methods to \ufb01rst generate potential bounding boxes  in an image and then run a classi\ufb01er on these proposed boxes. On the other hand, YOLO reframe  object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding box  coordinates and class probabilities. The system only look once (YOLO) at an image to predict what  objects are present and where they are. YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors  compared to Fast R-CNN.  The system divides the input image into an S \u00d7S grid. If the center of an object falls into a grid cell,  that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object. Moreover it stores a confidence store which  depicts the accuracy of the detection.  The model has trained its conventional layers on the ImageNet 1000-class competition dataset [1]. The  model is also been evaluated to PASCAL VOC detection dataset [2]. Thus different methods were  used to train the model for weeks and then it reached the final layer predictor which predicts both class  probabilities and bounding box coordinates.  Just like other detectors and any software YOLO too have limitations. The grids take space and can  have only one class so the nearby objects prediction % decreases an example is flock of birds. It  struggles on new objects.",

      "Project: DECENTRALIZED PEER-TO-PEER LEDGER FOR ACADEMIC RECORDS\nAdvisor: DR. ADNAN N QURESHI\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: Blockchain is an emerging technology, with almost daily announcements on its applicability to  everyday life. It is perceived to provide significant opportunities to disrupt traditional products and  services due to the distributed, decentralized nature of blockchains, and features such as the  permanence of the blockchain record, and the ability to run smart contracts. These features make  blockchain technology-based products or services significantly different from previous internet-based  commercial developments and of particular interest to the education sector that is founded on  timestamp record-keeping of titles of ownership. Within education, activities likely to be disrupted by  blockchain technology include the award of qualifications, licensing and accreditation, management of  student records.  From a social perspective, blockchain in academics offers significant possibilities beyond those  currently available. In particular, moving records to the blockchain can allow for:  \uf0b7 Self-sovereignty  \uf0b7 Trust  \uf0b7 Transparency & Provenance    142    \uf0b7 Disintermediation  \uf0b7 Collaboration  We find that the ability of blockchain technologies to create data management structures where users  have increased ownership and control over their own data could significantly reduce educational  organizations data management costs, as well as their exposure to liability resulting from data  management issues. It describes case studies of implementations at the Open University UK, the  University of Nicosia, MIT and within various educational institutions in Malta: each of these  implementations is in a piloting phase. However, even from these early pilots it is pertinent to conclude  that blockchain could probably disrupt the market in student information systems and loosen the  control current players have over this market. Blockchain technology will accelerate the end of a  paper-based system for certificates. Any kinds of certificates issued by educational organizations, in  particular qualifications and records of achievement, can be permanently and reliably secured using  blockchain technology. More advanced blockchain implementations could also be used to automate the  award, recognition and transfer of credits, or even to store and verify a complete record of formal and  non-formal achievements throughout lifelong learning.",

It is caused by a  stroke and it effect\u2019s the brain due to which a person is unable to speak, listen or see properly. Old  people are mostly victim of it. Now as these patients have a high ratio, not many hospitals in Pakistan  are working on such patients, but the doctors who work in these hospitals to deal with these patients  cannot cop up for longer. They might not be available sometimes. In this case the patient who is  dependent on that doctor is disappointed and wastes the day for his cure. Also highlighting the people  from villages who can\u2019t afford to be under custody of such doctors and neither they are literate enough  to understand English language. To cater all this we are planning to build a hybrid application that will  act as a therapist and deal with patients in both English and Urdu and will help them get cured and  back to their normal selves. When this app will open it will have 3 modules one will be for seeing one  will be for hearing and the last will be for listening. When talking about the seeing module when you  will open it there will be many options like alphabets words objects colors etc. there will also be a  crossword puzzle game in this module. When coming down to the next module which is the hearing  one the user will be provided with sounds of alphabets words objects and a few more things which will  make him listen and work on his listening skills. The last module, will the speech one in which the user  will improve his speech by speaking words alphabets objects and also sentences and also stories. Each  module will have a test module in it where there will be three levels of test starting from beginner to  professional level. The professional level will be based on pure normal human senses. If the user  passes this test with a good percentage then the user can consider him cured or almost cured. Each  module will have a test of its type but there will be a test module as well in which there will an overall  test of all modules combined. It\u2019ll have three stages as well from beginner to pro level. This app will  help an aphasia patient to get back to normal. The user can use this app in Urdu and English so the one  who can\u2019t speak English or don\u2019t know about it can learn from the Urdu module like people in villages  in Pakistan. We are also planning to add a module which will also deal with translation from Urdu to  English and English to Urdu. The user will enter a sentence which will be translated to the respected  language to the user can learn translation as well and thus this will help village illiterates to learn both  languages as well.

This architecture proposes a novel learning  and memory architecture for robots, which performs associative learning and recall of multi-modal  sensory patterns. The approach avoids the inclusion of task-speci\ufb01c expert knowledge and can deal  with any kind of multi-dimensional real-valued data, supporting incremental learning. The proposed  architecture integrates two machine learning methods: a topology learning algorithm that performs  incremental clustering, and an associative memory model that learns relationship information based on  the co-occurrence of inputs. Multi-modal sensory data are incrementally grouped into clusters. The  evaluations of both the topology learning algorithm and the associative memory model involved the  memorization of high-dimensional visual data as well as the association of symbolic data, presented  simultaneously and sequentially. The developed architecture and corresponding \ufb01ndings contribute to  the domains of machine learning and intelligent robotics.",

These transactions mostly include migrants sending money to their families in their home  countries. Remittances make up a good percentage of a country\u2019s capital flow, however, they are slow  to process taking up to four days for clearance. If this system is developed on the data structure of  block chain, the processing time of these transactions will be drop down to almost instantaneous.  According to World Bank by reported, the amount of remittance on a global level increased in 2018 by  10%. The global remittance percentage is expected to grow 3.7% in 2019, so the high processing time  must be lowered. One of the major reasons for remittances being slow, is that international remittances  are processed through third parties. If the system is based on block chain using hyper ledger composer,  we can implement smart contracts that will remove the third parties involvement in remittance. While  making these transactions, people have to pay some percentage of the amount to these third party    153    companies which can vary between 5-20% of the amount being transferred. Since block chain  implementation will remove the third party involvement, users will also be saving cost [er transaction.",

This issue is being  resolved with the help Artificial Intelligence. We propose an effective model that classifies DDIs from  the literature by combining an attention mechanism and machine learning techniques. Then, the system  will predict whether the drugs are safe from DDIs or not. Therefore, for this, we devise a model that  will train our algorithm to compare drugs and identify any drug interactions. This system will all be in  the form of a mobile application, where the user will enter the drugs names into the app. Then the app  will provide feedback of whether the drugs will have DDIs or not.            168",

The traffic wardens keep an eye on these things but whenever people get a chance they violate the  traffic rules, the main reason is that the traffic wardens cannot keep an eye on such incidents 24/7. So  to solve this modern day issue, we are making a system that will keep us updated for such incidents.  The system we are making will detect the flow of the traffic on each road, then by using algorithms we  will detect vehicles which are going the wrong way. And also scan the no. plates of such vehicles. By  doing this we will be able to reduce the daily traffic jams on road and less traffic rules will be violated.",

Before a movie is released, a  movie trailer is released to advertise and attract the audience to make up their minds whether to watch  the movie. One of the major reasons for a movie getting flopped is their trailer because mostly  audience watch the trailer carefully and then they decide that they have to watch the movie or not. So,  in this way a substantial amount of money is lost to the Movie makers. Building up such a platform  which can predict rating of a movie trailer can make movie makers to produce a better movie trailer  which in turn can attract the audience to watch the movie.

MUHAMMAD UMAIR\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: Maintaining good condition of roads is very important to avoid different road safety hazards. Usually  the process of detecting and identifying different road damages are done by a manual approach by  conducting visual surveys. This approach costs a lot of time and money. Therefore in order to facilitate  the maintenance authorities an automated system is proposed in this project that will be able to identify  and characterize the road cracks. The proposed system will be an android application that will be used  by the general public for reporting the road cracks in their nearby areas. The app will allow the user to  take a picture of the road crack. The app will then identify the crack using a trained Convolution  Neural Network and the severity will also be calculated. This data with the GPS location of the crack  will then be sent to the maintenance authorities. The maintenance authority will be provided with a  web interface to interact with the complaints. The authorities will see the complaints on a Graphical  Map. The places with the most complaints will also be highlighted on the map for the assistance of the  authorities. The data of all the complaints including the images, severity, GPS location and type of  road crack will be maintained using a database. False reporting will also be dealt by verifying the  complaint from the nearby users.",

      "Project: SMART SURVEILLANCE WITH POSE INVARIANT\nAdvisor: DR. MUHAMMAD UMAIR\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: The system to be developed will scan and recognize faces of the individuals of and organization using  face recognition algorithms. The facial recognition will not only be limited to frontal faces, instead, the  system will be capable to recognize the titled, rotated faces (Pose Invariance). To address this problem,  help will be required of the algorithms naming, Data Augmentation, Divide and Conquer, and Rotation  Router, Multi Task Convolutional Neural Networks. These methods will allow to successfully detect  faces which are looking away from the camera. The application will also keep track of people inside an  organization (Kalman Filter, Deep Sort Algorithm) and will also keep an eye out for any intrusion in    177    specified restricted area. Smart Surveillance will be a desktop application that will smartly monitor the  person in an organization. The application will use facial recognition algorithms to provide different  features such as tracking individual\u2019s presence and their paths, time duration spent in specified areas,  and notify the officials of the organization in case of any intrusion in the restricted area. The domain of  the application will not only be restricted to identifying the personnel\u2019s from the front; Instead, the  proposed application will be able to recognize and identify a person from side poses and various  angles. The proposed system is challenging to develop as there could be variations in illumination,  variability in scale, location and pose. Furthermore, facial expression, decorations and lighting  conditions can change the overall appearance, making it harder to recognize faces.",

The project will ensure that different audio tracks for the video are played across  different connected headsets. We all like to watch movies.

The only thing that  is the problem in this when two or more people decide to watch a movie but could not agree on a  language for the movie. One person wants to watch a movie in English but the other person wants to  watch it in Urdu. The solution we propose can offer language switching capabilities to the individual  person watching.

So, we will  be developing a system for an Autonomous Quadcopter, that will avoid obstacles. A Stereo Vision  Sensor will be integrated in the Quadcopter. This sensor will be used for obstacle avoidance so that our  quadcopter can navigate in an environment without any Collison. Stereo Vision Sensor takes two  images at same time on a given baseline. Then disparity map is calculated from these images. This  disparity map is then used to generate Point Cloud. When we get Point Clouds, they give us  information about the data in the image. Then nearest objects are identified using that information  given by Point Cloud. Then by applying Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm the Quadcopter will  circumvent it through the gap. All the testing will be done in Simulation. Later if time permits it will  be ported to real Autonomous Quadcopter.              179",

Recently,  malwares are increasing at an increasing rate that it has attracted the researchers to invent new methods  of malware detection. However, till date an approach is not suggested which is able to detect zero-day  malware. Researchers and antimalware community have developed three main techniques to detect  malware: signature based, heuristic based and behavioral based. Signature based detection is the most  used technique by the commercial antivirus software, but similar to the other two techniques it is  unable to detect a zero-day malware. In recent years Machine Learning has got attention to improve the  existing solutions to overcome malware issues.

SAAD AZHAR\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: Toxicity in comments refers to the use of unethical words in comments. In online conversations,  people get aggressive due to different reasons like hatred, anger, the difference of opinion/s, and etc.  Due to any of the previously given reasons, people may abuse each other and/or pass negative  comments which make the people leave the conversation. Whenever these kinds of behaviors are  reported, a human moderator needs to check manually whether the report is correct or not. A human  moderator check is not feasible, so this problem should be solved by an automated solution. Previously  researchers have also worked on automated solutions but due to some problems, this remains unsolved  and is posted on Kaggle as an open challenge. The challenge addresses the problem of unintended bias  prediction of toxicity in comments due to the imbalances in the dataset, which needs to be reduced to  improve results of prediction.  A possible solution to the given challenge may be to use machine  learning algorithms to detect toxicity in comments. The initial dataset is provided by Kaggle which we  will use in our project. We will use this dataset to train and test our model, and when this phase gets  completed new comments are given to the model for prediction. For new comments, an unsupervised  approach based on balancing the training dataset will help us in reducing the unintended bias  prediction of toxicity in comments. Our findings suggest that due to the use of slang words and  language being evolved, it makes the problem a challenge. We conclude that we cannot give an  accurate solution but a solution that can reduce unintended bias in the prediction of toxicity in  comments to a reasonable extent.",

SYED ATIF MEHDI\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: Agriculture is a component of Pakistan's economy as it provides the raw materials for industry down  the line and helps alleviate poverty. This sector has contributed 19.8 per cent of GDP and remains by  far the largest employer to absorb 42.3 per cent of the total labor force in the country. Currently, citrus  fruits are grown in Pakistan on an area of 206,569 hectares with a production of 2.36 million tons in  2015-16. Citrus fruits are divided into different groups of sweet oranges, mandarin, grapefruit, lemon  and lime which are commercially grown. The agriculture sector of Pakistan has been producing vast  amount of citrus fruits. Considerable amount of Kino is produced throughout the entire region of  Punjab and it supplies 2.3 million Kino per year. The agricultural institutes state the loss of citrus  production have increased in the last few years, due to the spread of citrus diseases, causing fruit and in  some cases whole tree to get infected, making it a non-consumable product. More than 98% of citrus  fruit is produced in Punjab and 70% of citrus fruit is produced in Kino. In fact, in the country, Kino  monopolized citrus farming. Unmaintained fields of citrus fruit result in rotten and useless crops. Not  every farmer has proper knowledge of the disease that citrus fruit can process. This results in great loss  of economic resources of the country. Providing services to every field to check whether the crops are  suffering from disease, which makes managing the fields difficult. Citrus fruits are infected through the  leaves which are contaminated due to diseases like citrus canker and citrus greening. Escalation of  such diseases leads to the ruin of citrus fields which can cause farmers to lose a considerable amount of  income. Detection of such diseases can save citrus fields which will, in turn, lead to effective growth in  Pakistan\u2019s GDP. As the agriculture sector contributes 42% in the entire GDP. For the detection of the  diseases, we will use a rear RGB camera of an android cellphone. The image taken from a camera will  be subjected to image preprocessing. Features will then be extracted from the image and through these  features, machine learning algorithms like SVM, K-MEANS and CNN will be able to classify and  detect the disease.            199",

This will help former to fill up free spaces. Usually the small growers take 2-10 acres of  land under varying contracts to cultivate the fruit. Almost 40,000 per acre Strawberry small plants  planted in mid-October every year, the fruit is usually ready for harvest in January. By mid-February  the harvesting gets in full swing only to end in April. Our farmers don't use seeds but instead they use  plants. When the rain comes, the real problem is faced and the plants get ruined. After that the farmer  had to replace the ruined or dead plants with the new one and the empty spaces had to be filled. In  Pakistan, nearly 10,000 plants per acre are spoiled in each harvest every year. So our idea is to count  total number of alive strawberry plant and detect total number of spoiled strawberry plants and also  detect empty spaces and their respective location through GPS co-ordinates.",

But now a days we hardly see any desi wrestling in Punjab because of the lack of  funds and proper management of this sport. Our goal is to develop a multi-player 3D game which is a  digital and virtual reality-based version of traditional Kushti. Because in Pakistan, the interest of  people towards our culture is decreasing day by day. Development of Dangal will contribute in  generating the interest of people towards our cultural game. It is a well-known fact that currently  people love to play games on their phones, computers, and laptops. Typical genres of games include  action, adventure, role-playing, simulation, strategy, sports games, idle games etc.  Our game (D for  Dangal) falls under sports and action category of games. Currently action games are developed as  platform games, shooting games, fighting games, survival games, battle royal games etc. Our game "D  for Dangal" is purely reality-based game and with real moves and characters. Our local culture  comprises of sports activities, i.e. purely fun-based like Bandar Killa, Gulli Danda, Bantay etc., and  physical activities that demand sound health e.g., Desi Kushti (also called Dangal). Desi Kushti is  primarily a multi-player game generally comprised of two types of activities: training and combat  however, combat phase takes two forms, i.e. one-to-one Dangal and Dangal as tournaments. The  playing field is called Akhara and there are specific moves, different than general wrestling. One of the  primary focus of Desi Kushti is to prepare a person\'s physical health and his character about how to use  physical health in order to defend his community and to serve his community, whenever required. Our  proposed game "D for Dangal" is actually a 3D game intending to develop a digital and virtual reality- based version of traditional Kushti. It consists of three phases: training, exercise, and Dangal.  In  training phase, user (wana-be Pehalwan) goes through preparation of eatable like breaking almonds  and walnuts. Then during exercise phase, the user performs sit-ups, push-ups, squats, cover a distance  with weight etc. in order to gain points and to shape his body structure by developing muscles. And  finally, in the Dangal phase, he faces his opponents.',

There are over 50 million patients worldwide, majority being people from  underdeveloped countries. Biggest problem caused by the seizure is the involuntary movements of the  body which may lead to fatal injuries. An epileptic seizure cannot be stopped; however, we can  minimize or eliminate the damage caused by the seizure if we know it is coming and take appropriate  measures [1]. To predict the seizure, we will try to use neural networks and other machine learning  techniques on EEG data of patients. For the dataset, we are using CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database. This  is a publicly available dataset which is being used for research purposes. We will try to get a higher  accuracy with our proposed model and publish our findings in the form of a research paper.",

However, there are still some flaws in the diagnosis  reports due to unavailability of the proper dataset. Our motive is to develop a desktop application  which will automate the process of breast cancer classification from mammographic images. Breast  cancer is second most common type of cancer around the globe.     Mammographic images are very  useful in detection of breast cancer. For detection of unusual growth of tissues and blocks of blood can  be seen in mammographic images. It is somewhat time consuming and difficult task sometime  performed manually by medical experts. Over the last decade, from various research results it is being  observed that it is very time consuming method but it will get faster if we use image processing  techniques. Different breast cancer detection algorithms have been developed in the past few years.    203    Normally, CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) is very challenging and it is yet to be fully and  satisfactory solved. The main aim of this system is to make an automated system for detecting and  identifying the breast cancer cells from normal mammographic images.

These disabled people use visual language (achieved by hand gestures,  movements of arms and body language) i.e. Sign language to convey their message. It is difficult for a  normal person to understand it clearly. Therefore, to remove this gap of communication we have  proposed a solution to develop a system with an android interface by using some python modules and  algorithms including dataset, image processing, and machine learning. This system is a two-way  communicator which will help two people with different abilities to come and communicate with each  other confidently. This system is divided into two components. The first component consists of text to  ASL conversion in which input has been taken in the form of text in the English language i.e. some  limited words and then words are mapped with equivalent ASL gestures. The second component  consists of ASL gestures to text conversion from a real-time video and then it will be mapped in text.

Now there is a  huge communication gap between Pakistani public and elected representatives (Local bodies and  higher authorities). Moreover the Unavailability of the elected representatives (Local bodies and higher  authorities) in the region is also the major issue. Issues of Pakistani public in their respective region are  being ignored and delayed by the state. For the accountability of the state there is only a single institute  called NAB (National Accountability Bureau) which is also the part of the state therefore the state  itself cannot do accountability of the state.

In  many cases the damage is escalated because either the elderly is living alone or because no one is  nearby at the time the incident takes place. The project is basically a framework we\u2019re creating that  would provide emergency services to the people and we are taking a start from fall detection. The fall  detection system is specifically for the elderly people either living alone or have no one to keep an eye  on them all the time although it could also be used by the handicaps. The approach we\u2019ve taken is  Sensor based, due to a number of reasons such that it is relatively cheap and has no privacy concerns  unlike the vision-based approach. The goal is to accurately detect a fall and provide the emergency  services to the affected as soon as possible. To carry this out an SMS service would be used and as  soon as the fall is detected a sms would be sent to the emergency services centre as well as the  guardian. An application needs to be designed where the user would be able to sign up for the services  being provided and a fall detection circuit needs to be developed that the user would wear. The  components required for the circuit include (Accelerometer/Gyroscope), Breadboard, Arduino, GSM  module, WIFI Module and a battery to provide power to the circuit. One of the biggest challenges in  fall detection is the accuracy of falls so multiple algorithms need to be applied and tested on the system  in order to get most accurate results. According to several researches, the combination of  accelerometer and gyroscope data has proved to determine falls more accurately as compared to any of  the sensors alone since accelerometer measures kinetic force and gyroscope can help to estimate  current posture. In the wearable devices, a fall is distinguished from daily life activities so there are  extremely low chances for a false fall detection. Such devices are often rejected by the elderly people  because of the difficulty of wearing it but irrespective of this, there are many other advantages such  that they\u2019re cheap, easy to operate and set up.",

LODHI\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Our product is a windows compatible software which is known as \u201cSVS\u201d (Signature verification  system) and it is used to distinguish between real signatures and forged signatures. The area of  Handwritten Signature Verification has been broadly researched in the last decades and still remains as  an open research problem. This report focuses on offline signature verification, characterized by the  usage of static (scanned) images of signatures, where the objective is to discriminate if a given  signature is genuine (produced by the claimed individual), or a forgery (produced by an impostor). We  present an overview of how the problem has been handled by several researchers in the past few  decades and the recent advancements in the field. The offline Handwritten Signature Verification  (HSV) problem can be considered as having difficult data since it presents imbalanced class  distributions, high number of classes, high-dimensional feature space and small number of learning  samples. No wonder that institutions and businesses recognize signatures as the primary way of  authenticating transactions. People sign checks, authorize documents and contracts, validate credit card  transactions and verify activities through signatures. As the number of signed documents and their  availability has increased tremendously, so has the growth of signature fraud. According to recent  studies, only check fraud costs banks about $900M per year with 22% of all fraudulent checks  attributed to signature fraud. Clearly, with more than 27.5 billion (according to the 2010 Federal  Reserve Payments Study) checks written each year in the United States, visually comparing signatures  with manual effort on the hundreds of millions of checks processed daily proves impractical.",

      "Project: SPOTGARBAGE\nAdvisor: MR. KAMRAN SHABBIR\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: Waste management in Pakistan is a matter of big concern. According to research, more than 5 million  people die each year in Pakistan due to waste-related disease. It is estimated roug0hly that 20 million  tons of the total garbage is produced every year in Pakistan. Pakistan being the 6th most populated  country in the world has a lot of consumers and as a result of that, a lot of garbage is produced, and  annually, 250,000 tons of waste is being produced by hospitals which are toxic of all the. There is a  lack of facilities in Pakistan to maintain the garbage causing hazardous toxins to be exposed thereby  threatening human and environmental health. People being exposed to toxic wastes causing different  types of skin problems and lung problems. This toxic waste contaminates groundwater. Contaminated  water can have a serious impact on all living creatures, including humans, in an ecosystem. It is  causing diseases like hepatitis which is a deadly disease. It claims nearly 150,000 lives every year  being a direct cause of death or morbidity and it means that over 400 people are losing life to hepatitis  every day here in the country.  We are trying to step up from the manual Garbage Management System to the autonomous Web and  Application-related interface. For this, we need to train a machine to detect garbage from the image by  comparing it to the pre-fed dataset of garbage. But due to a lack of resources, we will first make our  dataset by taking manual snaps of garbage heaps and dumps. This application allows people to click an  image of the garbage and send the prediction information along with the geo-coordinates (Longitude  and Latitude) to the municipality for clean-up by using several tools and real-time detection. The  detection will be done using image processing and machine learning techniques. In addition, this  application will be doing route optimization and planning for the waste busters trucks. The route will  be mapped, for all the pictures received in a specific time slot.                  222",

SADAF BALOCH\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: Motivation: The prevailing transportation system has a lot of conventional flaws and we have the  tendency of replacing this system by an application that can solve a lot of problems and provide ease in  travelling to and from the university. Problem statement: Travelling by university\u2019s transport one  must always keep an eye out for the bus to arrive, ending up reaching the arrival or departure point too  soon or too late. Losing a belonging for good, no security measures of who is boarding the bus. Admin  provides printed bus cards, calling and managing drivers, rushing everywhere in case any driver's place  needs to be filled doing everything manually. Approach: The approach to overcome the problem, we  decided to make a web application for the admin to carry out all the work done which they usually  handle manually. A mobile application is made for the registered user who can keep track of their  transport/ Results: A basic solution is provided by us to the university to handle all the transport our  web and mobile application. Admin can easily manage all the users, drivers, buses even there routes  etc. Conclusions: Our app is able to provide ease to the university students and staff, a user is able to  look for certain routes they are comfortable with and book a seat in a bus for a semester, the algorithm  in the app will not only allow them to do this but also track their bus. Voucher can be downloaded  from the app. The admin can manage the buses and drivers, the app will allow them to introduce new  buses and routes, deleting a route etc.",

It also contributes to the  depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from the sun's UV rays. Another negative effect  of air pollution is the formation of acid rain, which harms trees, soils, rivers, and wildlife. Air pollution  is responsible for major harmful effects on human health, animal lives, natural ecosystems and the  man-made environment. As detecting the levels of gases in air is a difficult task and require hardware  and its management.

SYED ATIF MEHDI\nStatus: Completed\nDescription: Time series analysis and forecasting is a useful technique for identifying essential trends that can be  helpful to make future decisions. One of the most challenging issues in the modern economy is making  financial judgments under numerous sorts of economic policies and reforms. High volatility shifts in  instability patterns are common on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSE). When it comes to Monopoly  and stock market predictions, there are numerous aspects to consider. We started with a static website,  then moved to a dynamic web application, but the data was still stored statically. Now, we've moved to  a full Mern Stack application that scrapes the data on the runtime and displays it to the user. The user  can download the data as a csv file to check the historical data, and the user can also see a candlestick  chart to help him understand the stock's trend. The numerous models used in stock market forecasting  provided have all been classified in terms of data preparation, forecasting methodology, performance  evaluation, and performance measure. However, in order to attain high forecasting accuracy, these  discussed models have not been sufficiently discussed in data preparation in order to overcome the  issues  of  randomness,  uncertainty,  and  stock  price  volatility.We started by attempting to anticipate only the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSE), but now we'r e aiming to predict overseas stocks as well, based on our data collection and many models. The Arima  model, the long-short term memory model (LSTM), the linear regression and a few others were  observed. The long-short-term model (LSTM) and the hidden Markov model (hmm) results are  encouraging.. We chose the long-short term model (LSTM) and ARIMA because their root mean  square error (RMSE) is lower than others.",

It has impacted all areas of the planet and took  countless lives, put the globe in menacing disorder. The most serious issue is that it spreads. Spreading  of COVID-19 has adjusted the human's social experience particularly one's portability. Two  conspicuous methodologies have been taken to kill the COVID-19 infection or control its spread which  are creating vaccines or utilizing social protocols individually. Numerous vaccines have been  researched over, only few of them have been developed so far that generally works by embedding  antibodies against the infection's cells to battle them in the body which body in any case creates at a lot  more slow rate. At the point when enough number of individuals gets inoculated, many bodies become  vaccinated against the infection subsequently leaving the infection inadequate. In any case, vaccines  are losing their viability as COVID-19 is changing and new variations are being the reason for fast  expansion in the instances of COVID-19 once more. A few norms of strategies for socializing have  been additionally placed in spots to prevent individuals from collaborating with each and adequately  decreases the spread rate. Nonetheless, this is troublesome methodology to follow as individuals are  requesting their social portability. One approach will be to use digital contact tracing. It is digital  method to tell civilians of infected spaces of COVID-19 patients so they can adopt pre-emptive and  dynamic strategy to secure and disconnect themselves.",

Customers have  gotten smarter and prefer to see the food before believing it is good enough to be ordered. The visual  composition of food on a plate is the primary part that decides the human comprehension of adoration  and capacity to pay. Our sense of sight affects desires and perceived enjoyment of food.  Nowadays, as the customers wait patiently for their meal, the visual depiction may be appreciated as a  means to keep clients entertained/distracted. Some customers may find it difficult to order if their  knowledge about the dish or language is limited. Others ought to neglect to choose a meal that doesn't  affect their wellness, confidence, health, or morals. Any other issues are less likely to arise when  visually preparing a customer before buying.  We aim to provide an application to the users where they will view the food items in Augmented  Reality (AR). They can also view the health bene\ufb01ts, ingredients they are allergic to such as peanuts,  eggs, chocolate, etc., main ingredients, and reviews from other people. Users can also order food  directly from the application, which would reach their tables. An augmented reality-based restaurant  menu would provide easy access to essential information about dishes to improve the food selection  process for customers and help the restaurant industry bring value to customers by creating realistic  representations of dishes before they place an order.",

The problem nowadays is that due to the pandemic,  people avoid going outside because of the threat being caught in virus and also due to lockdown most  shops close prior to the time a working person gets free. We are suggesting such an environment where  the user can have a real-life market experience. By real life meaning that things that are bought online  have a fixed rate, we are offering the user to as for discounts on a certain product according to the  user\u2019s price range. The user negotiates on the price with the chat-bot that we are going to include for  the ease of the user. Our main goal is to make an online mart where the user can buy products minding  his price range, not getting out of his comfort zone and finalizing a trustworthy deal.  End project will be a website which will work like an online shopping mart. The user will visit the  website. Search for certain products. If a product is of user\u2019s liking go to the chat-bot. if the user wants  to ask for discounts, then he can chat with the chatbot and if the user does not want to ask, he can buy  the product directly.      249",

Abnormality  detection in the musculoskeletal study is backbreaking as more than 1.7 billion people are affected by  musculoskeletal condition (BMU, 2017). Hence if we want to create enough opportunity to treat a  maximum number of patients, machine learning and deep learning can play a crucial role. CNN is an  excellent deep learning method for image classification and other computer vision tasks.  In this  System we use python libraries like cv2, NumPy etc. and we are required a minimum of 16 GBs of  ram and 6 GB of GPU. Common methods, we use deep neural networks for feature classification. In  theSystem CNN classifiers cannot train directly because of the loss of image details from resizing at  input layers. The X-rays images are preprocessed before they are classified and these images are  preprocessed with demonising, edge detection and histogram equalization and CLAHE.This study  investigates new model architectures and deep transfer learning to improve the performance in  detecting abnormalities of lower extremities while training with limited data. DenseNet-169, and  AlexNet deep learning models were implemented and evaluated on the LERA, a large public dataset of  musculoskeletal radiographs.

It has two main types namely Acute and Chronic. These are further divided into two  subtypes, Lymphoid and Myeloid. The diagnosis of leukemia is most commonly carried out using  cytogenetic testing i.e., observing microscopic blood smears and bone marrow images. These manual  testing methods take weeks to process and detect the cancer. Multiple machine learning techniques  such as k-nearest neighbor, na\u00efve Bayes, support vector machine, decision table are also used for  comparatively faster diagnosis than the traditionally used manual methods [1]. Still the result of such  methods and the time they take for the diagnosis is not satisfactory. To make the overall process more  efficient and precise, we will use Image Processing techniques (Image Segmentation, enhancement,  and augmentation) to achieve the most out of the limited datasets available, and then CNN models  which perform much better than traditional models by automatically extracting related features and  classifying cancer in same and sometimes lesser time span will be used.",

      "Project: FRAGILE WATERMARKING OF MEDICAL IMAGES\nAdvisor: MR. SAEED IQBAL\nStatus: Completed\nDescription: These medical images are exchanged for number of reasons among which are teleconferences among  clinicians, interdisciplinary exchange between clinicians and radiologists for consultative purposes or  to discuss diagnostic and therapeutic measures for distant learning of medical personnel. However,  these applications require more attention towards image protection (availability, confidentiality and  reliability). To facilitate sharing and remote handling of medical images in a secure manner,  watermarking guarantees attractive properties. It allows permanent association of image content with  proofs of its reliability by modifying the image pixel values, independently of the image file format.  Fragile watermarks are those that are easily destroyed by tampering or modifying the watermarked  content, hence the absence of watermark to the previously watermarked content points to the  conclusion that data have been tampered with, and thus are used for data authentication applications.  One can use the fragile watermarking for authentication of medical images. First the image has been  segmented that separates the lung parenchyma from the rest of the CT scan image, then three different  types of watermarks are embedded in the host image by replacing the least significant bits (LSBs) of  the cover segmented image. LSB is a simple fragile embedding technique with a high embedding  capacity and small embedding distortions. The LSBs of the image are generally considered as noise  inherent due to the image acquisition devices. So, these bits can be used for secret message embedding  without greatly disturbing the image appearance. The scheme serves for both the purposes of medical  image authentication and hiding electronic patient record (EPR). A medical image in the case of  clinical outcome can be divided into two parts: the region of interest (ROI) where the diagnosis focuses  and the region of non-interest (RONI), which is the remaining area. Usually, it is desirable to embed  data outside of ROI to give better protection without compromising the diagnosis information",

For instance, when the user is in front of the camera it will first verify  if the subject is live or not. Then, it will utilize machine learning algorithms to distinguish the facial  expression. If the user is smiling, then that implies that the user is in a joyous or a pleasant mood.  Using this data from the live feed the algorithm will get the input of mood, which will the generate  music from a model trained on a piano tones dataset to create new and unique tunes. These tunes will  be played in the music player. Also we are ensuring that the data is not being collected for malicious or  personal intents through our application, this is being done to maintain security and integrity of the  application. The video feed will not be recorded for security purposes. It will ask for the users consent  to use the camera and during the live feed no recording will take place. Also the user can replay the  music generated by the application using the music player.      257",

Our system will ensure to provide the best and worst  reviews and ratings. It enables buyer to choose the best shop or brand for any product which they want  to buy according to their ratings and reviews. Many same products sold at different stores with  different ratings and reviews which are available at different social media platform like Facebook and  Instagram, etc. People don\u2019t have time to go to these platforms and check their ratings because it is  little hectic to check out different pages. Our system will solve this problem by providing different  reviews and rating on single platform. In this project we will cover different food restaurants,  electronic shops, medical shops and different Pakistani makeup brands. We will gather ratings and  reviews from different social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn etc. through  scraping. We will also categorize these reviews in different categories like best, normal and worst by  analyzing the reviews. Machine learning algorithm will be applied for these analysis. We will also  provide our own rating in future. We will gather these ratings and reviews from those people who have  bought something from these shops and brands.        258",

It slowly destroys the thinking ability of an individual in the sense that the  individual loses the ability to think or perform the daily life chores, and stops living the normal  lifestyle.  The treatment to this specific illness is as complex as the illness itself, and is usually very  costly. As a solution to assist caretakers; our product targets the main issues which have to be dealt  with, which cover food, medication, sleep, and tracker. Alzheimer patient support is a hardware- software solution-based product which is a cost-effective solution to the illness of Alzheimer which  cannot be fully treated but can be slowed down with its progress among any individual who is  diagnosed with it.  We will be using sensors (pressure and motion) to generate signals using our  hardware devices which include smart medication box, smart food box, wearable device which will  make sure that the individual who is diagnosed with Alzheimer has a proper diet and medication  intake, along with that whether the individual has been able to have a normal sleep pattern and the live  location of the individual will also be noted all the time. All of these details will be noted through  forms of graphical representation in our software solution which is the mobile application. The device  and mobile application both will be controlled by the care-taker of that particular patient and these  records will be saved in the database of the application through which our product will give a record of  the conditions and progress of the patient so that the care-taker and the medical officers both will be  able to comprehend the condition process of that individual. Thus, Alzheimer patient support as a  whole will be a cost effective solution to this real life problem and will enable the patients to get back  to their normal lifestyle of life and feel less like a patient.",

Significance of book reading is undeniable. There is a substantial portion of students who want to read  books or those who need some books and those books are exceedingly rare, very costly, and difficult to  buy a new one. The readers need to have a solution to buy their required books in affordable prices.  Our project focuses on searching and borrowing books for reading. Like there are many students those  cannot afford the expensive books and then there are students those are willing to donate or sell the  books on reasonable prices, the prices which are lower than the market price, so it will be useful for  both who needs books and for those who wants to sell or donate the books. There will be two types of  users. One user will post a book that he or she has already read and is of no use, the second user will be  able to search that book and request the book from the owner. Owner can also sell the book if he/she  want they can post the book with the price and other users can buy it from them. The project is based  on mobile application development. The end product will be an application which will have two users  one will upload a book which he/she wants to sell or donate on the application and the other will have  the access to purchase or borrow that book. And once the book is donated or it has been sold it will  notify other users that this book is not available or it has been sold. It will keep update everyone who's  using that application about available books and the books which are not available.",

Infants can gradually improve their  cognition through parental guidance and self-exploration. However, conventional learning methods for  robots often focus on a single modality and train a pre-defined model by large datasets in an offline  way. It is a hierarchical autonomous cognitive architecture for robots to learn object concepts online by  interacting with humans. Two pathways for audio-visual information are devised. Each pathway has  three layers based on the self-organizing incremental neural networks. Our task is to improve this  algorithm with a better one, i.e. TCA. Plasticity stability dilemma is one of the major problem that we  aim to resolve through this algorithm. Visual features and names of objects are incrementally learned  and self-organized in an unsupervised way in sample layers, respectively. Two symbol layers abstract  the cluster results from the corresponding sample layer to form concise symbols and transmit them to  an associative layer. An associative relationship between two modalities can be built in real time by  binding activated visual and auditory symbols simultaneously in the associative layer. The learning  procedure of TCA is divided into five parts namely (i) winner node selection, (ii) vigilance test, (iii)  node learning, (iv) topology construction and (v) kernel bandwidth adaption. The experimental results  on two objects datasets and a real task show that our architecture is efficient to learn and associate  object view and name in an online way. What is more, the robot can autonomously improve its  cognitive level by utilizing its own experience without enquiring with humans.",

Social robots that interact with humans in their everyday  lives are exposed to a dynamic and challenging environment. This dynamic environment provides  continuous data streams that are potentially infinite and non-stationary. Hence, in such a complex  environment, robots are required to continually acquire new knowledge and adapt to unpredictable  changes over time by remembering aspects of past interactions with humans.  Our proposed model will be able to acquire new knowledge over time while preserving previously  learned tasks without retraining an architecture from scratch is referred to as lifelong learning (LL).    263    We will develop our algorithm on the principles of ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory) so this is also a  challenge for us to understand the implementation of ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory).  At the end, we make a system in which we know how to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, i.e., how to  prevent the loss of previously learned knowledge when new tasks need to be solved.  A key  characteristic of such systems is the ability to acquire new information without compromising  previously learned knowledge, i.e., without catastrophic forgetting.",

If we talk about only one major city of our country like Lahore. According to the collected  data from the city traffic police, there are a total of about 6.2 million vehicles and 4.2 million  motorcycles are present only in Lahore. You can gauge the sheer number of vehicles in Lahore by  comparing the number of vehicles in Lahore with the 19.6 million vehicles in the entire province of  Punjab. This shows that Lahore has around 32% of vehicles in Punjab. But City Traffic Police Lahore  with its 3000 traffic wardens and 215 Senior Traffic Wardens are covering the entire city. It is very  difficult to increase the traffic personnel as it will increase the cost to the government. Traffic  violations also cause traffic jams and cause of heavy traffic on road. Those people who obey traffic  laws frustrate form these events. So, there should be a platform where people can do some things to  those offenders. Installing cameras on all roads will cost a lot. If it is only a city in the county, then it  can be done but to cover the whole country it's impossible, and if it is then too costly.

Likewise, Handwritten text recognition is one of the  significant areas of research and development with a streaming number of possibilities that could be  attained. Handwriting recognition (HWR), also known as Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), is the  ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper  documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices. Signatures are widely used as a means of  personal identification and verification. Many documents like bank cheques and legal transactions  require signature verification. Signature-based verification of a large number of documents is a very  difficult and time consuming task. Consequently, an explosive growth has been observed in biometric  personal verification and authentication systems that are connected with quantifiable physical unique  characteristics (finger prints, hand geometry, face, ear, iris scan, or DNA) or behavioral features (gait,  voice etc.). As traditional identity verification methods such as tokens, passwords, pins etc suffer from  some fatal flaws and are incapable to satisfy the security necessities  Our main objective is analysis of recognition accuracy for machine learning and deep learning  algorithms.

HAMAD UL QUDOUS\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Definitely, a person wants to grow his new firm in the market, he would require a good advertisement  of his firm. The major issue that comes in between is the connection with celebrities in order to hire  them for marketing purposes. Generally, we make contact with certain merchants first and then they  further schedule meetings with us to present our offer and which takes a lot of time and efforts to  contact the celebrities. Also, there are certain other dealers between the firm and the celebrity then it is  hard to explain the exact marketing work to the celebrity and so far so forth, the connection with that  celebrity is weak. The signing of agreements takes time and the dealers related to certain firm and the  celebrity keep their cut which makes the more consumption of amount of money. It is being noted that  for this marketing technique, the way communicate with the celebrities is thought to best by sending  them emails, which takes a lot of time to reply. A celebrity is never really free to reply emails at the  same time and sometimes, they do not even read the mails. So, our application is going to deal with  these kind of problems in making connections between the influencers and the one who is in need for  marketing. By using our application, all food bloggers, tiktokers and youtubers can make money  easily.",

The problem they face is that there is no automated  system to book these arenas. Therefore, we are introducing an application that helps them in this  regard. Not only for the players but also for the owners of these grounds and pools so they can manage  their daily bookings, cancellations etc. The website would be linked with the mobile application as  anything that is changed in the mobile application or bookings that are made will be updated on the  website as well. Many functionalities will be included in the application that will be specified by the  user himself. Therefore, the hassle to call the arenas or physically go there to book the ground for a  certain time period will be eliminated.",

The project aims to incorporate state-of-the-art techniques for object detection to  achieve accuracy with real-time performance. A major challenge in many of the object detection  systems is the dependency on other computer vision techniques for helping the deep learning-based  approach, which leads to slow and non-optimal performance. Computer vision is consists of various  aspects like image recognition, image generation, object detection. In this project, we are using highly  accurate object detection algorithms and methods such as R-CNNN, Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,  RetinaNet, and fast yet highly accurate ones like SSD and YOLO. Using these methods and  algorithms, based on deep learning which is also based on machine learning requires lots of  mathematical and deep learning frameworks understanding by using dependencies such as  TensorFlow, OpenCV, imageAi, etc, we can detect every object in an image by the area object in a  highlighted rectangular boxes and identify every object and assign its tag to the object. This also  includes the accuracy of each method for identifying objects. In this project, we use a completely deep  learning-based approach to solve the problem of object detection in an end-to-end fashion.",

Many products and services are  being invented or getting updates every time and on daily basis. Still there are some problems and  areas where some applications can help humans to work out with the problems. For same kind of  problem our group proposed an idea to help humans from a job which is nowadays think as focusing,  demandable, and full attention job which is data entry. This job requires so much resources where time  is the most important one. The organizations need to hire people who are required to do this job with  continuous and full attention to enter data from different documents into data warehouses such as excel  files, local databases, etc., which can be done manually by writing them manually or by local software.  We produced solution that we will design a module which will require a single input in form of an  image of a specified resolution from which that system will detect the type of document whether it is  an invoice, a purchase order, etc., by using machine learning and NLP techniques and algorithms then  will extract meaningful information from it according to the type of document e.g., in case of invoice it  could be quantity, total price or client name etc. and will create a runtime query which will then be  used to enter the extracted information into the required database. The ML techniques will help to  detect type of document, to extract data from document with help of NLP techniques and to transform  it in digitalize form too. After this extraction and transformation process of information, system will  ask for confirmation of extracted information and then after confirming, create a runtime query which  will upload the extracted information in the required places such as respective tables and columns in  database.",

MOHSIN SAMI\nStatus: Completed\nDescription: In today\u2019s time; researchers, scientists and health workers are looking forward on advanced  technologies that can help and speed-up the medical processes but are also budget friendly. Keeping all  these factors in consideration we have come forward with an advanced technology of Deep Learning  that will help in Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). Diabetic retinopathy is a common  complication of diabetes and major cause of vision impairment and blindness worldwide. It is a  condition caused by diabetes that affects the retina damaging retinal blood vessels making them leaky  or blocked. Abnormal blood vessels can grow from the retina, which can bleed or cause scarring of the  retina and result in permanent vision impairment or blindness. Vision impairment most commonly  occurs due to thickening in the central part of the retina (diabetic macular edema), which can lead to  irreversible vision impairment. In present times, the diagnosis is done by subjective human evaluation  that is slow, time-consuming and resulting in clinically hard monitoring of DR. With our automated  approach, the process of diagnosing such a disease can be easier, flexible, fast and most importantly;  budget friendly. Furthermore, it can prevent the loss of vision in up to 95% of cases by early detection,  combined with appropriate treatment and management. DR is the manifestation of systemic disease,  which affects up to 80% of all patients who have had diabetes for 10 years or more. Automated DR can  be implemented using various algorithms like computer vision, machine learning/deep learning, and  deep neural networks. But deep learning in general has achieved high validation accuracies. So, based  on our research we will be using Deep Learning for our project and Python computer language along  with some Image Processing techniques. Following are the different stages that we will go through to  complete this project.",

This project will bring the  innovation in our society. Usually, a person has to manually open the door or hire a person who will  check whether a person is authorized or not. This application will help solving this problem. As it will  detect a human face and if it recognizes that face, then it will decide whether to allow the person to  pass or not. If the system will not be able to recognize the person, then it will send a notification to the  mobile application and ask the user whether to unlock the door or not. If the user allows to unlock the  door, then it will be unlocked instantly but if the user does not want to unlock, he can send a recorded  voice message through mobile application which will be played to the person standing outside. This  project comprises of a mobile application (IOS and Android), web application and some hardware  tools.

To empower the player to control the game instinctively, this review  utilized a right now famous Arduino innovation to do plan of intuitive control gadgets for computer  generated reality. The interaction design in this project is based mainly on a virtual reality Boxing  game. To let players, carry out punching more intuitively in the boxing game, this project used actual  sensors, called \u201cArduino\u201d. The implemented system was roughly divided into two components: an  oculus module and a receiver system module connecting to the server host. According to the results,  our system cannot only realistically display 3D visual effects, but the Arduino sensations can also  provide intuitive real-time game interaction for the user.",

Usually photographers  have to first take a photograph then edit all of them. Already they have a lot of work so they can never  sort of filter out specific client wise photos or the junk photos from that large collection. This is  hindrance effects professional level photographer as well as amateur level photographer. We want to  give them an online platform where they can simply upload images in folder and all the images will be  tagged and classified by the people in the images. This way photographer will not have to separate the  images by themselves which is a hectic work to do. All the processes in this application will be  automated. Users just have to create a project (event) and attach their folder created on drop box to our  application and share the joining link to the participants where they can join to find their images at a  particular event. They can also view and download images from face cloud application according to  the photographer\u2019s permission. Imagine work of many days taking only minutes with our application.

It is estimated that by 2050 over  700 million people or one in every ten will have disabling hearing loss. Today, the estimated total  population of Pakistan is 200.81 million, which means that there are approximately 10 million hearing  impaired citizens in Pakistan. Sign languages are developed around the world for hearing-impaired  people to communicate with others who understand them. There is a persistent communication gap  among deaf and non-deaf communities because non-deaf people have less understanding of sign  languages. So, our system will be going to recognize the sign and sign motion of deaf people. This  system will be going to help many people who don\u2019t know sign language.

These  vulnerabilities exist in JS Libraries which are used while developing the site which results in the theft    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 289  of personal information, data loss, and denial of data access during data transmission. Web  applications(websites) use HTTP/HTTPS protocols to request and fetch data from the servers. These  protocols have one or more fields inside the header, where most of the exploits and payloads can be  injected by the attackers. According to The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), 80% of  the web attacks are done through HTTP/HTTPS request queries. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of  those online security attacks in which malicious code is injected into web applications from  untrustworthy sources. And when the legitimate user tries to access that page, the page will be loaded  on his machine and XSS scripts run, which results in stealing of personal information. Our model uses  CNN LSTM to train from the dataset and for the detection of XSS attacks in live traffic. Our study will  provide a comparative study of using 1CNN and 2CNN for the detection of XSS attacks. The system  will also be able to alarm the admin for suitable action if an attack is detected.",

More than one  in five consumers have alleged inaccuracy in their credit file by the Report appeared in CNBC on  September 27, 2017. Lenders respond to this incorrect data by offering higher interest rates, less  favorable terms, or denying credit. For this, we are developing Factiiv network whose focus is on  decentralized reputation in which the participants are self-sovereign entities establishing reputation.  Reputation is created by lending or satisfaction with products/services and its inverse, attested by  incentivizing participants where successful or fraudulent attestations will affect their reputations. These  steps will be performed to generate credit reports which provides detailed information about credit  activities of a person/organization, represented by credit scores. This report helps lenders to determine  how likely they will get back their loan and measuring individual\u2019s reputation.

It involves the Realtime Data Retrieval. That\u2019s mean, Realtime Clothes Store  has ability to server code push content to connected clients instantly as it becomes available, rather  than having the server wait for a client to request new data. Realtime Clothes Store will support "server  push" functionality, in which server code can call out to client code in the browser using Remote  Procedure Calls (RPC), rather than the request-response model common on the web today. Realtime  Clothes Store will be a Progressive Web Apps (PWA). PWA is intended to work on any platform that  utilizes a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile contrivances. The main  benefits of PWA are that we build only one app which will run on both platforms and it will available  in offline mode. We can also show notifications on mobile notification bar using PWA. The other  paramount conception which makes Realtime Clothes Store more valuable is that we are introducing  MACHINE LEARNING in our application to enhance our sales performance. Using Machine  Learning, we will build a model to check when we need sales. Using Machine Learning Models, we  will be notified by the system that what products are not selling. System will suggest the % of discount  for the sale automatically. The other strategy which makes Realtime Clothes Store more different is  that we are introducing different Gaming Activities in our application.

The main concept behind SDN is to separate the control plane from data planes. The  structure of controller is centralized so, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack that can easily  exhaust the switches and their communication and computing resources and also the controller. Thus,    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 294  they breakdown the whole network within a short time. This method will detect and also mitigate the  DDoS attack by using hybrid technique entropy and destination IP address and time-based mitigation.  The main objective of this research is to propose a light weight and reliable method to detect the range  of DDoS attack at its early stage. In old-style networks by congesting, they try to bring down the  services running in the network. With extra traffic loads or to reduce the network speed by congesting  the available bandwidths. Therefore, a huge load of attack traffic targets a certain destination. In  software defined networking the attack traffic could be distributed as much to skip the detection  mechanisms to target the controller and switches.",

Now days we don\u2019t have such surveillance  system that can produce a useful output. Many incidents happen but are not reported because there is  no such system in existence that can report these incidents. Today, due to cheap technology, we have  large number of videos i.e., surveillance videos which are the main source to capture real time  abnormal activities but for automatic detection of different anomalies, we need to design a system  which took such surveillance videos as raw input and then produce a useful output. The output means  the specific anomaly which needs public and authoritative attention so that such events can be  minimized or at least properly deal on time. So, by using the surveillance videos and incorporating  deep learning solution with the data, we may be able to assist the humans to detect anomalies at the  spot. Our project aims to make these cameras useful at detecting crime in real time. Our system will  analyze the raw footages and will detect anomalous activities. If a camera detects an anomalous  activity, it will trim the specific anomaly part and will report this anomaly to the concerned department  which should deal with the anomaly like in case of arson, our software will notify the fire department  and in case of road accident, our software should notify Hospital and Police department. Our system  will be able to detect anomalies in any surveillance videos. Our system will store surveillance videos  categorically in database for further easiness of system.",

FARHAN DAWOOD\nStatus: Completed\nDescription: Computer-aided diagnosis is a computer-based system that is used in the medical imaging field to aid  healthcare workers in their diagnoses. Skin disease is known to have a significant impact on quality of  life. Skin diseases are the fourth leading cause of human illness. Even though it is not fatal in most  cases but it can cause discomfort and affect the quality of life. If it is detected early chances of  successful treatment are greater. Dermatologist performs a non-invasive test by looking at the affected  region, however there is a chance of human error due to diagnostic in accuracies and as a result disease  detection can be missed. Also, classification of skin disease is difficult due to many similarities  between different disease symptoms and there is minor difference in how they look. In this era  technology machine learning can assist us identify and classify these different diseases. Classification  of skin lesions in various cancerous type plays a crucial role in diagnosing various, local and gene  related, medical conditions in the field of medical science. Classification of these lesions in several  cancerous types i.e., Melanoma Neves (NV), Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Actinic Keratosis  (AKIEC), Benign Keratosis (BKL), Dermatofibroma (DF), Vascular Lesion (VASC) gives some  insight about disease. Skin cancer are most lethal type of cancer but patients have high recovery rates if  the disease is discovered in its early stages. We propose a skin cancer detection and classification  system based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The cell images are fed into a CNNs model to    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 296  extract deep-learned features.

Especially the vehicle-based systems ensure fast, secure transmission and accurate recording of  the data. In order to overcome these challenges, this work is adapting Block chain technology for real- time application. Therefore, the main novelty of this project is to develop a Blockchain-based system  in order to establish a fast & secure system that will be entirely decentralized.   Current vehicle registration systems have not been able to mitigate against the threat of tampering with  the vehicle owners\u2019 details or at least keep track of the fraudulent transactions in the system. This has  informed the need to review the current motor vehicle registration systems as well as the challenges  faced in the registration of vehicle ownership details.  Block chain technology enables the development of decentralized business models that can be used to  improve the safety and security of critical data. Based on the weaknesses of the current systems we are  developing a system based on blockchain technology where the newly manufactured cars can be listed  and registered on our system and when those cars are bought by the customers the ownership of the car  will be transferred to the customer. In this way, we are keeping a track of all the transactions that were  performed in the system including vehicle registration, transfer of vehicle ownership as well as  veri\ufb01cation of ownership transfer.",

One huge problem that arise there is  customers frequently find large grocery stores to be a maze. Trying to locate required products in a  large store can be a difficult task, resulting in tension, frustration, and wasted time. Similarly, if a  product is out of stock, the consumer will not know until he or she goes to the rack to look for it, which  can be rather stressful as well as customers are unaware of products on sale. The solution we propose  is to create an application that will assist customers in getting to their desired goods, as well as keeping  track of their budget and alerting customers if they have gone over budget. The application will also  display a message if the product that the customer is looking for is out of stock. Moreover, it will also  notify the customer if the desired product is on-sale.

This application will search for vehicles nearest to your desired location and within minimum time  limit. The owners (whose vehicle meets the requirements of the user), willing to rent out their vehicles,  will be broadcasted with a notification and they can choose either to rent out or not.  Both owners and users can set the price range for the vehicles based on time (per  hour/day/week/month).",

The public transportation  system is one of the biggest hurdles in our developing nations.  Public transportation is a necessity for the welfare of modern culture and has a significant impact on  people\'s productivity, and consequently, on the entire process of economic development. In order to  develop solutions that will work, various solutions have been examined.  One of the initiative options is "carpooling," which is centered on a group of people using a single  shared car to commute daily to the same place. Additionally, carpooling is an effective way to get  around the drawbacks of the traditional transportation system by taking shorter, more convenient, and  environmentally beneficial automobile trips. This study introduces a smart carpooling mobile software  for University of Central Punjab commuter students. The foundation of the proposed methodology is  data mining, more especially the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) technique.',

Despite  decades of research and development of new treatment options, the overall outcomes of patients with  HCC continue to remain poor. There are areas of unmet need in risk prediction, early diagnosis,  accurate prognostication, and individualized treatments for patients with HCC. Recent years have seen  an explosive growth in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in medical research,  with the field of HCC being no exception. Among the various AI-based machine learning algorithms,  deep learning algorithms are considered state-of-the-art techniques for handling and processing  complex multimodal data ranging from routine clinical variables to high-resolution medical images.  This project we will be a web application with artificial intelligence that will diagnose HCC  efficiently  and accurately , which will replicate the same jobs performed by human physicians. In this project we  will gather data sets (ct scans )and then then the data will be processed and after that we will train the  model  And after that we will test the model. At last it will be able to take the images using api and  show the results to the user.",

Such a task should not be as  difficult as is the current practice. There is a dire need for a reform to take place where the individual  may focus on more crucial aspects of their professional career instead of focusing on passing through  the red-tapism to get their degree verified.  On the other hand, there is also a need for employers to verify the credentials of an individual directly  instead of contacting the relevant authorities repeatedly.  Previously, this was implemented by using normal databases, but those systems fall victim to  intrusions and fraudulent changes to the original credentials of an individual.  The need for a secure method to implement this system demands the use of blockchain to accomplish  this task. Blockchain is a secure platform which with the use of smart contracts would ensure that the  credentials entered have been verified by the authorities and no further verification is needed for the  employer or for the individual.  Degrees and transcripts can be verified through such a system where the administration can enter the  credentials of the individuals and the smart contract will be deployed on the TestNet which cannot be  changed once deployed where it can be verified by employers or can be attached in the resume by the  individual. Verification will be done by a web interface which will have different profiles for  individuals, employers, and admins, each having a certain level of authority.",

However, many organizations need to verify signatures several times, so online signature  verification cannot be used everywhere since it requires real time signatures. To overcome this issue  Offline signature verification system is needed so that signatures can be verified anytime, when  needed, merely with the help of signature image.

Therefore, we are developing an  efficient application that makes ease by identifying vehicle model, manufacturing year and color. We  have a dataset of approximately one million (936051 images of 55527 vehicles from 400 models)  vehicles to help machines learn the model, manufacturing year and color of each vehicle. Furthermore,  the dataset currently does not have the color information for the vehicles. By using this dataset and  other AI techniques, we will help the machines to learn the make model, manufacturing year and color  of each vehicle. By using the vehicle color classification technique for classifying vehicles into seven  categories under different lighting conditions via colour correction. One major problem in vehicle  colour classification is that for any given colour, there may exist many shade colors: For example,  shades of white (Pearl, Alabaster, Snow, Ivory, etc) and shades of black (Charcoal, Midnight, Ebony,  Onyx, etc). Traditional methods cannot classify vehicles with shade colors because a wrong classifier  is designed by putting vehicles with the same label together even though their chromatic attributes are  different. The separation can significantly improve the accuracy of vehicle color classification even if  vehicles are with various shade colors and captured under different lighting conditions.",

The application will allow the Users to add / remove and modify the components of    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 319  their cars. Such as by choosing from the availability of a variety of Rims, Tires, Headlights, Tail lights,  Spoilers and other modifiable products virtually by just scrolling and tapping on the product they want  to add on their vehicle. Despite all, the users would be acknowledged by the details of the products  they are adding on their cars. Details will also include Price details, Brand name of the products and all  in all at the end users can save the screenshot of their modified cars which will eventually help them  with the idea of how they want the final look of their car. It\u2019s a user-friendly application that allows the  users to achieve their vision/goal about how they want to make their car look. One of the biggest  problems that people have to face is the availability and purchasing of the spare parts of vehicles. In  the market the users can not try out any accessory on their car unless they purchase it. The second  problem that users have to face is they are unsure about how their car would look once they make  certain changes i.e. changing the accessories/modifying their specific car. The third problem that users  usually get in trouble is with the right pricing of the available products in the market. The fourth  problem is that users are doubtful when it comes to the reliability and the authenticity of the available  accessory/product. A user-friendly web/mobile based application that allows the user to modify their  vehicle virtually at home. This will save the precious time of the user and will also help users to get  acknowledged by the availability of the aftermarket products available in the market for their car. The  application will also help them to learn about the whereabouts and the current state of the market along  with the prices and they will be able to purchase the available accessories after previewing it on their  vehicle. This will eventually help them in achieving their goal/vision that they have set in their mind  regarding the modification of their car.",

SAJID SALEEM\nStatus: Completed\nDescription: <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 320  The last century has witnessed a rapid increase in the population of the elderly people in the developed  and industrialized countries. This phenomenon is not restricted to the western world only, but many  countries such as ours are now feeling the impact of this transaction. This situation could be attributed  to a combination of factors such as increase in age, longevity and decreased death rates due to  advancement in the field of medicine, improvement of life expectancy at birth, and enhancement in the  average span of lift. Pakistan ranks 12th in terms of absolute size of elderly population .The country is  not adequately equipped to look after their special health needs and the changing traditional value  system. A feeling is now growing among the aged persons that the attitude of the younger generation  towards them is not as desired.  The data was collected using a specially designed Interview schedule and observation technique  through a house- to-house survey for those residing in the families. Non-working status of these  women and above 60 years of age was criteria for sample selection. Results of the study revealed that  most of the elderly felt the attitude of the younger generation is unsatisfactory towards them especially  those who were in old age homes in terms of getting respect, love and affection from the family  members instead they were considered as burden for others. Women living in the families had a  positive attitude towards old age. The social relationship of the elderly women living in families and  those living in old age home also differed.  Old Age Home Platform is a web application that provides an end-to-end smart web application for old  age people and old age homes. In this platform firstly, we will create a Chabot which will answer the  users some of their FAQs. This platform will provide the login credentials to all the siblings/ child of  the old age home users so they can check their health and food diet on daily basis. With this platform  they can also check whether their forefather/ guardian is critically ill or needs visit. In this platform we  will add e-commerce functionality so if anyone want to donate, they can donate as well. As this is not  for single old age home so in this project, we will target all the old age home of Lahore.",

The experience is similar to watching a professional sporting event except  that instead of watching a physical event, spectators watch video gamers compete against each other in  a virtual environment. E -Sports describes the world of competitive and organized video gaming.  Competitors from different leagues or teams face off against each other. Fortnite, PUBG, Apex  Legends League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and Call of Duty to name a few. These gamers are  watched and followed by millions of fans all over the world who attend live events or tune in on TV or  online.    Whenever online gaming tournaments are held, they are held manually. By that what we mean is  normally there aren\u2019t many platforms where teams can register themselves and have a record of their  payments of fee. This creates security and integrity issues.

Since there are hostels or other options listed on  websites like zameen.com but most of them are just for the advertisement of the property dealers. The  pictures they attached are not even reals sometimes. But If you find a good option the prices are double  for the bachelors. And if we talk about the hostels, So, we thought what if we ask about the insights  from the people already living in that particular hostel. So we decided to make a web application that  solve this particular problem of bachelors. By using this platform they will find a suitable  accommodation according to their own and reserve their seat in a particular hostel they want to live.  They even get in touch with their fellow hostelites and seek help.  For making web application hostelites we are using MERN stack frameworks. In which we will use  React.js, Node.js, Express.js and Mysql as the database. We will also develop a cross platform  application base on React Native. We will use escrow system for online payments so students can  reserve their seat without any fear of fraud.Initially this application will be used as an redirection  application to redirect the user to our website using a QR code scanner.

It is a digital currency thus it does not exist in physical  form or hard notes. There are many digital currencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Ethereum  Classic, Solana, etc. Our study is especially focused on the most well-known cryptocurrency, i.e.  bitcoin. With time the world is shifting to digital technologies. Cryptocurrencies play an important role  in the digital economy in advanced countries. In recent years cryptocurrency took a boom in price. The  value of bitcoin as an investment asset has been rising. Its highly volatile character necessitates the  need for accurate forecasts upon which to base investment choices. For precise prediction machine  learning play an important role in bitcoin price prediction. Our goal is to apply efficient prediction  models based on machine learning, specifically Time Series Based and Multivariate Autoregressive  algorithms to predict the fluctuation of bitcoin price and to obtain maximum accuracy. The bitcoin  price is majorly based on the factors which we have selected for our study. These factors cover all the  aspects of bitcoin, including trading, mining, and sentiment.

You have to visit different  locations hence consuming your precious time, costing you a lot only for the selection of your event  location. You have to visit different vendors for different services i.e. Transportation, Bridal Makeup,  Photographers and Decorations. Bigger problem is to find good organizers. We are going to create a  platform that has listings of Events Complex of all major cities of Pakistan as well as the tourist  destinations. For events user will be able to book an event far away from your home without visiting  the location. User will be able to choose his menu, decoration, staff, and seating plan. We will make a  Web Application where the user able to register himself and the service providers as well. We will add  reviews and rating system in our project and using sentimental analysis through machine learning we  will rank the services providers. From different sources we will do data extraction to extract meaning  full data like rating, reviews and info etc. Platform itself will recommend you best service provider  according to your needs. For businesses they will be able to register themselves and their services for  customers. This will help businesses to get more traffic and grow especially for new businesses who  want to visitors and shoppers mainly so customers will be able to get a view of services they provide  and based on their ratings and reviews they will be able to decide which one is best for them.",

Teacher may mark incorrectly without paying attention. Traditional call out system takes at least 5 to  10 minutes which is too much in a sixty minutes lecture. Teachers also have to take the attendance  twice to confirm that they have marked the attendance correctly. In most of the cases Teachers take  attendance at the start of lecture which causes trouble for the Students who join the class after  attendance. For those Students Teachers have to take attendance again which cause disturbance for the  whole class by breaking the rhythm of class. The Students who have completed their leave quota and  are just an absent away from course withdrawals are always in danger to be withdrawn by the Teachers  unintentionally by a slight mistake of Teachers. On the other hand, the Teachers too remain in danger  of marking attendance incorrectly. So, they have to take attendance with their full focus. In this    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 329  procedure more time is required than expected.

MUHAMMAD BILAL KHAN\nStatus: Completed\nDescription: Musculoskeletal conditions will increase as the population of the world ages [1]. For radiologists to  obtain second opinions and to facilitate cases where radiologists are not available, an automated  system capable of analyzing x-ray images is necessary. By using deep learning techniques and the  MURA dataset, this project intends to serve this need by binary classifying X-ray images as normal or  abnormal. The MURA (Musculoskeletal Radiographs) dataset classification is a project undertaken by  researchers to develop algorithms for the automated classification of musculoskeletal radiographs. The  images are organized into seven body parts (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, finger, ankle, and foot). The  goal of the project is to develop algorithms that can accurately classify specific body parts as normal or  abnormal. To achieve this, the researchers are using a deep learning model based on convolutional  neural networks (CNNs). The CNNs are trained on a number of different images in order to learn the    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 332  features of each body part, and the model is then tested on the MURA dataset. Results show that the  model is able to accurately predict the normal or abnormal classification of radiographs with an  accuracy of over 80%. This project is an important step forward in the development of automated  medical diagnostics, and could potentially reduce the need for manual interpretation of medical  images.",

The game will support both first person and third  person perspectives for the player to switch between at their convenience.   The game world will consist of multiple levels stacked upon each other like floors and each level will  be a small world with its own theme. Each level will contain 2-3 towns. In these towns, there will be  plains, jungles, deserts and other such environments that the player will have to go through in order to  travel from one town to another. The areas between these towns will be challenging areas that will  contain hostile monsters which will attack players as soon as they are noticed (by being seen or heard).  Besides these monsters, players may encounter other players as well and they may fight each other  without any restrictions. However, the towns will be safe heavens where no combatant will be  permitted. Besides this, there will be a dungeon (a tower like structure) as well. This dungeon will be  the pathway towards the next level and the players will have to clear the dungeon containing monsters.  At the end of the dungeon will be a staircase guarded by a powerful boss like monster and the players  will have to defeat it in order to climb the stairs to the next level.  A quest (missions) system will be implemented. Players may receive quests from Non-Player  Characters (NPC) which they can complete to gain experience (EXP) points to level up. The tasks of  the quests may be as simple as gathering items or as difficult as killing a certain number of monsters.  Leveling up will increase the player\u2019s health, strength, stamina, speed etc. EXP may also be gained by  killing monsters and completing certain achievements.     <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 333  The combat system in this game will be strictly melee. Close quarters weapons like great swords, one- handed swords, hammers, lances, nodachis and katanas etc. will be available and the player may freely  choose their weapon of choice. Unlike other MMOs, there will be no class system in this game.  Instead, there will be a proficiency based system that will give the players the freedom they want  instead of restricting their weapons through certain classes. Unlocking skills for weapons will require  you to reach a certain proficiency with that weapon\u2019s type and higher proficiency will be needed to  wield high tier weapons. Proficiency in weapon types can be gained by using the weapons of that  specific type to kill monsters.  The game will have basic slash attacks which can be chained together in different manners to perform  certain combos. Furthermore, there will be some special attacks that will require timed input with  proper coordination in order to be executed (These will be known as Skill Attacks). These attacks will  replace the traditional method of \u2018One button for a skill\u2019, which is implemented in most MMOs and  they will create a sense of skill in the game. Besides attacking there will be mechanisms to Evade,  Block and Parry. However, there will be some Skill Attacks that may be unlockable or non- interruptible.   There will be a basic level implementation of a marketplace where players may buy and sell weapons,  armor, healing potions, antidotes etc.",

      "Project: LUNGXAMINER-LUNGS DISEASE DETECTOR THROUGH X-RAY IMAGES\nAdvisor: MR. SAEED IQBAL\nStatus: Completed\nDescription: Nowadays, in order to diagnose or predict any diseases on humans, we must have a proper diagnosis in  order to predict the disease that is present in that human body. In general, for illness prediction, we try  to employ X-Ray, CT, or MRI scan techniques to make a judgement on the suitable disease. In general,  a medical professional must be well-versed in the relevant subject in order to detect abnormalities in  humans. Patients generally suffer from long appointments and doctor's unavailability, which wastes  time, and in the event of an emergency, patients are unable to receive treatment on time, which leads to  more severe diseases such as advanced stages of lung cancer. People who are experiencing financial  difficulties may be unable to afford these appointment charges or fees.   The approach we propose is to develop a lung disease detector application that uses Deep Learning  techniques and algorithms to detect the crucial three diseases, which are Pneumonia, Covid19, and  Lung Cancer. We employ two models, Vgg16 and Vgg19, to predict lung disease from chest Xray  pictures and then determine which model has the best accuracy and performance. Normally, a chest X- ray is used to detect any abnormalities in the lungs and to provide detailed information about the lungs.  So, our program will request x-ray scans from patients and provide a report indicating whether or not  they have pulmonary problems.",

WAQAR MUGHAL\nStatus: Completed\nDescription: As we know that some patients do hesitate from the awkward odor of the hospital and some feel  hesitated and face the problems in booking of appointment from the doctor. Patients also face problem  to buy medicines in hospital and waiting in a long queue. Sometimes, the queues are so long that the  patient has to suffer a lot while waiting for his/her turn. They waste their time in such activities. What  if there was some kind of hassle-free system where which we could use to overcome these challenges.    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 343  What if there was a mechanism which the patients could use to avoid these long queues which make  them wait for hefty amount of time. There are also many people which cannot go for a routine checkup  physically to the doctor because their homes are too far away from the hospital or they live in a rural  area form where it is not too easy to reach the hospital or a clinic to have a checkup form a specific  doctor. To overcome all the problems, we are going to design a web-based application for sorting out  these types of problems. We will solve the problems of the patients which they usually face in their  routine. Similarly, after getting checked by the doctor, searching for the prescribed medicines is also a  difficult task because here in our cities, we have experience that it is not necessary that the prescribed  medicine will be available at every medical store. So, the patient has to do hassle to search the  prescribed medicines by the doctor. We are also going to solve this problem by reading the doctor\u2019s  prescription and finding the prescribed medicine form different online pharmacies and from the  pharmacies which are will be liked to our system. This will help us find the prescribed medicines  easily and make the patient tension free. The same procedure we are going to follow for the  laboratories as well. The main goal of our project is to facilitate the patient in every way we can using  our web-based application. \u201cClinical Medics\u201d.",

Most farmers working one dimensionally because of uncertainty of finding buyers of the yield  at the right price.  3. Lack of proper yield production predictive analysis and losing crops due to floods and rainfall.  Another problem at consumer end is lack of organic food including fruits, vegetables and most farm  products and eaters are forced to shift to packaged foods which can never match the quality of an  organic product. It has the following causes:  1. Inconvenient and expensive to go buy organic products directly from farm.  2. Forbiddance to keep farm-pets in metro areas.  3. Lack of land and expertise to cultivate their own crops.  To solve these problems, we have proposed an android application which revolutionizes the  relationship between end consumers and farmers and in turn solves each of these problems by creating  alternative processes with fewer people involved.

Despite of being  different from normal verbal communication, it also changes with the change of region. This project is  about creating a web-based dictionary/corpus where different organizations/schools/individual for  deaf/dumb people will login and upload the videos of different signs related to a particular word. A list  of words will be provided by editorial that we need signs of words i.e. w1-w10. Users who logged in  will view the list and upload signs related that words in this way we can gather the sign language of  particular word from different regions of the country. Then we will have reviewers which will be  basically sign language experts who will review the data from the crowd and on the basis of number of  similar signs that sign will be standard for that particular word.  The problem domain is that we don\u2019t have a generalized/standardized data set of Pakistan sign  language (PSL). The 5000 words that are added on Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) website/book are  the words which they bought from USA and even they are not standard signs because USA sign  language varies from one state to another state.  By this project a platform will be created having standard signs against each word which will be  further used in future for building dictionaries for deaf people.    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 354",

Before  the internet people would collaborate for a lot of things which would result in friendship and spending  times but now a days, we make things easy and most of these collaborations have become a thing of  past and making friends have become difficult. Loneliness can become stressful and unfit. Another  issue is that we move a lot and to new places so having a gym/game buddy is difficult to find.  Another issue is to find a right fit for competitive esports. We tried Facebook and there we never find a  good fit for different games like Valorant, CSGO and Dota. The problem was that the person we would  get was too low profile and sometimes too high and they won\u2019t fit together either we would leave after  a single match or they. Actually, this problem arises from the need of communication in games so to  play efficiently you need to communicate with your teammates.  So, to overcome these issues we thought of a platform where we are able to see others profiles and  their reviews and the roles they are playing in sports/esports. Furthermore, we conducted some  interviews with sports and esports players and got some requirements like managing tournaments,  hiring coach.

USMAN AKBAR\nStatus: Completed\nDescription: <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 358    Drop for life is a social practice that help people to maintain their basic life. Nowadays, we see that  people lose their precious life without getting the necessities of life at right time. The national poverty  rate in Pakistan increase by 2.5 to 4 percentage points which means 5.8 to 9 million people into the  poverty. Some of these have nothing to eat and clothes to wear, they are unable to take at least two  meals in a day. About 0.75 million children are not getting education due financial issues. The aim of  this application to facilitate these people by providing a platform where they easily get donation in  form of food, clothes, furniture and money for education purpose.  Blood is an important factor that is very essential in the life of every organism. Millions of people lose  their lives for not getting blood at the right time in emergency due to unavailability of donor or  improper contact of the donors. This application Drop for life is also work as online blood bank that  helps people by performing blood bank operations effectively.  Another purpose of this application some people who wants to start their work by their own, our  application provides free mentorship sessions, and short courses in which they can learn some skills.  Our mission behind this to provide effective guidelines.  Drop for life is also designed to support donor to donate money, food, clothes, furniture, blood and  funds. The donor doesn\u2019t have need to search a needy one. The main problem that needy people face  there isn't a single platform that can accommodate all the donation features, including blood donation,  charitable giving, food, clothing, furniture, money donations, and education. To donate different  goods, the donor needs switch across platforms. Therefore, there would be a platform that offers all  these features collectively to enable simplicity for the donor and the acceptor in order to avoid this. By  providing these facilities to donor and receiver it will save millions of lives every year.",

The symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease will develop  gradually, beginning with slight tremoring to mental and behavioral changes, balance coordination  problems, having hoarse, breathiness and tremor to voice.  In order to diagnose this disease in its early stages, we have decided to train a hybrid model for  detecting Parkinson\u2019s using voice recognition and spiral drawings datasets. The deflections in the voice  will confirm the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease using voice, while sudden, sharp changes in spiral  drawings will confirm the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease using spiral drawings.

      "Project: DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR LOAN APPROVAL\nAdvisor: DR. DAVID SAMUEL BHATTI\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: The existence of numerous online loan platforms and applications offers individuals a convenient  avenue to secure loans. However, a critical issue arises as these platforms exhibit remarkably low  success rates in terms of loan repayments. Bloomberg's projections for 2023 suggest a global loan  default rate ranging from 5% to 8% in first-world nations, particularly affecting corporate loans. This  concern becomes more pronounced on online lending platforms in underdeveloped nations, where the  default rate escalates to a substantial 35% to 40%. The gravity of this situation is underscored by the  fact that the entire loan process, including applications, approvals, and disbursements, is conducted  online.  The online environment, while fostering accessibility, also introduces vulnerabilities. Dishonest  borrowers exploit the digital landscape, leveraging the lack of face-to-face interactions to conceal or  falsify information with the intent of fraudulently obtaining loans. This nefarious activity is facilitated  by the remote and automated nature of the lending process, making it challenging for lenders to detect  fraudulent behavior effectively. The absence of direct contact further complicates the verification  process, leaving lenders at a disadvantage in identifying and preventing fraudulent loan applications.   Moreover, the legal landscape exacerbates the issue. Lenders lack robust legal obligations regarding  borrowers' loan performance, further contributing to the prevalence of defaults. This absence of  stringent legal frameworks allows dishonest borrowers to escape accountability for their actions,  perpetuating a cycle of frequent loan defaults that adversely affect the financial health of these online  lending platforms. In essence, the confluence of online operations, inadequate fraud detection  mechanisms, and a lack of stringent legal obligations creates a serious challenge in the realm of online  lending. Addressing this issue necessitates a comprehensive reevaluation of the online lending model  to incorporate more robust fraud prevention measures and legal frameworks that can mitigate the risks  associated with loan defaults and uphold the integrity of the lending process.",

But this manual task  brings a lot of theft and food leakage problems that need to be solved. Moreover, meeting the vendor  physically is a time-consuming task and sometimes is very difficult in situations such as epidemics or  pandemics. To do that, our new and advanced inventory management system based on cutting-edge  technologies will provide a fast and reliable system that will handle and maintain the stocks and will  inform the owner about the shortage of items and how much is needed to order.   The order, only if the owner accepts the request, will be generated to vendors that will be received to  vendors on their online application. This will save the owner from losses and fraudulent activities and  will maximize the efficiency of the mode of communication between the owner and vendor. The items  that are sold the most will be displayed differently from other items and thus their ingredients will be  ordered more. The system will also keep a record of the sales of items at national events to generate  orders of stocks accordingly and to find the best and most costeffective packed products, the online  grocery stores will be searched by using our advanced AI mechanisms and provide us with reliable  items.

MUHAMMAD UMAIR \n \n<S25BS005> \nSDP Phase I (RS) \nPage 385\nStatus: Complete\nDescription: Background Problem:   Currently, AI-powered chatbot solutions like Babylon Health, ChatGPT, Aivo, and Mitsuku have  proven versatile, serving purposes such as virtual healthcare assistance, advanced language  interactions, and efficient customer support. These chatbots were created to make life more convenient  and reduce the amount of human work. So, the question stands there that, can a chatbot be used for  ethically taking user\u2019s consent and data on network and can a chatbot beused for monitoring network  activities like malware and phishing?   Proposed Methodology:   When a user connects to an end device like a router, a webpage automatically pops up on the screen,  initiating an interaction with a chatbot. The chatbot promptly requests the users to enter their details,  and if the user is not already registered, it guides them through the registration process. Once the  registration is completed, an OTP is generated and sent to the user's provided phone number. After  successfully verifying the OTP, the chatbot presents the network consent and policy, seeking for user's  agreement. Upon the user's agreement, ZTCB grants access to the network and simultaneously creates  a log file in the backend. After that ZTCB system shifts into monitoring mode, where it continuously  validates the user's activities. If any malicious intent is detected, the ZTCB promptly blocks the user  from the network, ensuring the network's security and integrity.   Expected Results:   The implementation of ZTCB is expected to yield several positive outcomes. First, the use of advanced  machine learning and AI technologies will enable ZTCB to efficiently detect and intercept malware  and phishing, reducing the risk of cyber threats for users. By promptly alerting users to potential  threats, ZTCB will enhance the overall security of their digital landscape. Second, seamless mobile  verification (OTP) for user authentication will establish a transparent and secure environment,  reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the network. Third, the real-time monitoring and analysis  capabilities of ZTCB will enable proactive malware and phishing detection, preventing potential  breaches before they occur. Overall, the expected results of implementing ZTCB include improved  network security, proactive threat detection, transparent user authentication, and reduced human effort.",

MUZAMMIL HUSSAIN\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized technological usage, enabling the  development of applications with minimal power and resource requirements. Among these innovations  is Deepfakes, a technology capable of convincingly altering videos and images, presenting profound  implications for privacy, security, and societal stability. The manipulation of visual content by  Deepfakes poses significant challenges, exacerbated by the complexity of detecting such alterations  due to advanced AI techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Addressing this  challenge, our research introduces a method to identify fake faces within images and videos. Our  approach begins with the identification of faces in visual media, followed by the extraction of intricate  facial features using the sophisticated Deep Learning model, DenseNet-169. Subsequently, these  extracted features are subjected to classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to  discern between genuine and manipulated content. Through comprehensive comparative analyses, we  have determined that the combination of DenseNet-169 and SVM offers the most effective solution for  detecting fake faces. In pursuit of broader accessibility and usability, we intend to develop a user- friendly web application utilizing Django, offering an intuitive interface to empower individuals in  verifying the authenticity of visual content. By bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and  practical implementation, our Endeavor aims to mitigate the risks associated with Deepfake technology  and foster informed engagement with digital media.    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 455",

      "Project: GAIT ANALYSIS\nAdvisor: DR. M. ADNAN AZIZ\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Gait metrics, such as walking speed, cadence, symmetry, and gait variability are valuable clinical  measurements in conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, osteoarthritis, stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple  sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. These gait metrics are routinely used to diagnose pathological  motion and plan treatment, and monitor outcomes. Quantitative analysis of motion is critical to  medical decision-making but is currently possible only with expensive motion capture systems and  highly trained personnel. It is complex and expensive and takes almost 30 minutes to setup the system.  Video-based pose estimation can be a low-cost, easy-to-use alternative to monitor motion. In our  proposed workflow, data is collected using a single commodity camera. The patient will walk back and  forth along a 10 m path 3\u20135 times. The patient will be recorded with a camera 3\u20134 m from the line of  walking of the patient. We use the OpenPose algorithm to extract trajectories of key-points from a  sagittal-plane video, these signals are fed into a neural network that extracts clinically relevant metrics  that are walking speed, cadence, knee flexion angle at maximum extension and gait deviation index.  The proposed model has the potential to enable low-cost surveillance of disease progression. Our  methods are dramatically lower in cost than optical motion capture and do not require specialized  equipment or training. A therapist or technician need not place markers on a patient, and our models  allow the use of commodity hardware (i.e., a single video camera).",

MUHAMMAD ZUBAIR\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains a critical challenge in artificial  intelligence research, particularly in tasks requiring human-like reasoning and adaptability. This  project aims to address the limitations of current AI systems, which struggle to generalize to novel  problems beyond their training data, by improving performance on the Abstraction and Reasoning  Corpus (ARC). The ARC benchmark evaluates AI\u2019s ability to solve abstract reasoning tasks that are  straightforward for humans but highly complex for machines.  To tackle these challenges, we propose a hybrid AI model that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs),  symbolic reasoning, and meta-learning. ViTs are employed for their advanced pattern recognition and  generalization capabilities, pre-trained on foundational datasets like EMNIST to establish core  reasoning abilities. Symbolic reasoning modules complement the neural approach by simulating rule- based logic, while meta-learning enhances task adaptability with minimal data. Key strategies include  transfer learning, data augmentation, and synthetic data generation to overcome the limited training  data provided by ARC.  This project delivers a multifaceted solution, encompassing the development of an AGI model,  research  publications,  and  a  web-based  platform  to  showcase  results.  Performance  will  be   evaluated against ARC benchmarks, focusing on generalization and success rates for novel tasks. By  advancing methodologies that bridge the gap between narrow AI and AGI, this research contributes to  the broader goal of creating systems capable of human-like cognitive reasoning and abstraction, paving  the way for future advancements in the field.",

      "Project: SECURE VOTING SYSTEM USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY\nAdvisor: MR. USAMA PERVAIZ\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: This project aims to revolutionize the voting process by addressing fundamental flaws in traditional  voting systems through the integration of blockchain technology. Traditional voting systems, whether  paper-based or electronic, face significant challenges including susceptibility to fraud, lack of  transparency, and inefficiency. These issues can erode public trust in the democratic process. Our  blockchain-based voting system proposes a solution by leveraging the inherent characteristics of  blockchain technology\u2014immutability, transparency, and decentralization\u2014to create a secure and  reliable voting environment. By recording each vote on a blockchain, we ensure that votes are  permanently and tamper-proofly recorded, thereby addressing key vulnerabilities of traditional  systems.      The core of our solution involves utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques and secure multi-factor  authentication to verify voter identity while preserving anonymity. Voters will undergo a robust  registration process that includes fingerprint verification and email or phone validation. Once  registered, each voter receives a private key to cast their vote securely. Each vote is then recorded on  the blockchain with a unique hash ID, allowing voters to verify their vote independently. This  approach not only prevents vote duplication but also ensures that all records are tamper-proof. Real- time vote tallying and result verification are made possible through the blockchain, providing  immediate and transparent access to voting results.  The project harnesses key technologies such as blockchain architecture, cryptography, and smart  contracts, with practical tools like Ganache for blockchain simulation and traditional databases for  voter registration. This combination ensures that the voting system is scalable, secure, and resistant to    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 545  potential threats. By integrating these technologies, the project aims to create a voting system that  enhances security, boosts voter confidence, and ensures transparency. The ultimate goal is to establish  a verifiable and immutable voting record that can serve as a model for future elections, offering a more  secure, transparent, and cost-effective approach to democratic voting processes.",

MOHSIN SAMI\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Agriculture is a cornerstone of every country's economy, and for Pakistan, an agricultural nation, it  plays a critical role in driving economic growth. Despite its importance, Pakistani farmers face  significant challenges that hinder their ability to thrive. Recently, the government lowered crop prices,  exacerbating the financial strain on farmers who already struggle with high costs for essential supplies  like seeds and fertilizers. This policy change has intensified the difficulties for farmers who must    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 574  invest heavily in their crops but see diminishing returns. Moreover, the exploitation by middlemen  adds another layer of hardship. These intermediaries purchase produce from farmers at substantially  low prices, reaping large profits while the farmers themselves receive minimal compensation for their  hard work. This system leaves farmers in a precarious financial situation, unable to earn a decent  living or adequately support their families. The disparity between the costs of production and the  returns on their crops creates a cycle of poverty and indebtedness among the farming community.  Addressing these issues is crucial to improving the livelihoods of Pakistani farmers and ensuring the  sustainability of the country's agricultural sector.  Few digital platforms worldwide have successfully addressed similar challenges. For instance,  FarmCrowdy in Nigeria and DeHaat in India have transformed agricultural markets by enabling  direct transactions between farmers and buyers, thereby ensuring better prices and logistical support.  Inspired by these successes, the EasyFarming App aims to implement a likewise model tailored to the  unique needs with Technology advancements of Pakistani farmers.",

      "Project: PASSENGER IMPORT SYSTEM\nAdvisor: MR. TAIMOOR HASSAN\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: The Passenger Import System is a web application targeted at solving the world problem of urgent  goods transportation. The central problem this project tries to solve is that traditional shipping methods  take weeks or even months to send goods between borders. Such a delay is problematic because, when  there is an urgent need to consume a product, it is available in some countries but not everywhere.  As  a result, the project will allow air travel to be used as a means for transporting goods to customers so  the delivery period should not exceed a day.  The  importance  of  this  issue  is  that  in  the  world  of   globalization,  faster  and  more  efficient  shipping becomes  a  necessity.  Traditional  freight   services  are  always  complicated,  expensive,  and  very  time- consuming.  Within  this  system,   passengers  become  couriers;  most  travel  with  free  baggage  space, making  them  flexible  and   cheap  options  for  international  shipping.  The  knowledge  areas  used  in  the project are web  development technologies; specifically, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and the  MERN   stack.  Additionally,  the  application  will  use  Artificial  Intelligence  for  personalized    <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 577  recommendations;  implement  secure  payment  systems  for  users;  and  manage  user  profiles  for   safe transactions between the customer and the passenger.  Added to this system will be the provision  of chat communication among customers and passengers, AI- based matching algorithms, and  verification process for the delivery of goods.  The  expected  outcomes  of  this  project  are  an   efficient  platform  where  the  customers  can  post transportation requests, passengers can bid to  transport goods, and both parties can communicate and complete transactions securely. In the end, it is  expected that the system will reduce transportation time and provide an additional source of income for  passengers and also give a reliable solution for urgent international deliveries.",

ADNAN GHAFOOR\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: <S25BS005>  SDP Phase I (RS)  Page 595  The Fog-Based Visibility Enhancement System aims to solve the problem of reduced visibility caused  by fog, which makes it difficult for autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems, and surveillance  cameras to detect objects clearly. Under foggy conditions, traditional RGB (Red, Green, Blue) cameras  often fail to capture clear images because fog causes light scattering, making objects appear blurry. On  the other hand, infrared (IR) cameras can detect heat but provide less detailed visual information.  To  overcome these issues, this system combines both RGB and IR cameras. It uses advanced techniques  to improve image clarity. One such technique, called Dark Channel Prior (DCP), removes haze from  RGB images, making them clearer and easier to interpret. The system also uses Wavelet Transform to  combine the RGB and IR images, preserving important details such as temperature (from the IR  camera) and color/texture (from the RGB camera). Additionally, the system applies a method called  CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) to enhance the image contrast, making  objects in the fog stand out more clearly. It also uses edge detection to highlight the boundaries of  objects, improving their visibility. The system processes these images in real-time using .NET  libraries, allowing it to quickly enhance and display images as the conditions change. By improving  the visibility of objects in foggy environments, this system helps enhance the safety and reliability of  autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems, and surveillance operations.",

DANIYAL AHMED\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: This project is about creating a smart and modern online shopping platform where people  can try on clothes virtually. The goal is to make online clothes shopping easier, more fun,  and more accurate by using 3D technology.  When a person visits the website, they can choose from four model sizes Small, Medium,  Large, and Extra Large. These models help show how clothes will look on different body  types. Instead of just looking at pictures of clothes, users can see how the clothes fit on a  3D model that looks more like them. This helps them understand if something will fit  well or look good before they buy it.  Another important part of the platform is the AI-powered chatbot. This chatbot is like a  smart helper. It talks to users, answers their questions, and gives suggestions. For  example, if someone is looking for a dress for a wedding or a casual t-shirt, the chatbot        Page 609  can recommend items that match their style, size, and preferences. It works 24/7 and  gives a more personal shopping experience, just like a salesperson in a store.  This system can solve common online shopping problems. Many people return clothes  because they don\u2019t fit or look different from what they expected. With virtual try-on and  smart suggestions, shoppers are more confident in their choices. This reduces the number  of returns, saving time and money for both the customer and the company.  In short, this platform combines technology and fashion to create a better way to shop  online. It gives people the comfort of shopping from home while offering an experience  similar to trying on clothes in a real store. It makes shopping more interactive,  personalized, and enjoyable.",

One of the most common complaints  by EV owners is the unpredictability and long waiting times at charging stations, which  causes frustration, delays, and inefficiencies in their daily commutes. The \u201cEV Charging  Booth Reservation App with AI Integration\u201d aims to address these issues by creating a  mobile  application  that  integrates  artificial  intelligence  (AI),  real-time  booth   availability  tracking,  and geolocation-based services to provide a seamless and user- friendly charging experience.  This project proposes an intelligent reservation system where users can pre-book EV  charging booths and avoid unnecessary delays. AI components in the application will  analyze historical usage patterns and battery levels to suggest optimal charging times and  stations. Furthermore, geolocation APIs will allow users to view the nearest stations and  navigate there conveniently. The app will interact with third- party APIs to fetch real-time  booth availability data and ensure accurate recommendations. By offering a  personalized,   predictive,  and  efficient  solution,  this  application  contributes  to  sustainable  transportation and improved resource utilization. The end product will be a scalable and  cross-platform mobile application supported by a robust backend architecture.",

MUHAMMAD BILAL KHAN\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: The Basant (a festival that was once widely celebrated) has lost much of its charm over  the years due to urbanization, growing safety concerns, and disinterest of the younger        Page 627  generation. Additionally, many modern games lack cultural representation and fail to  promote outdoor activities, leading to a lesser connection to traditional experience. To  preserve this custom, we are aiming to introduce Guddi Gladiators (a 3D kite battle  game). Our game aims to bridge the gap between people and Basant by combining  traditional kite flying with modern technology.  To create an interactive and engaging game, we will utilize Unity 3D for game  development, Blender for 3D modelling, and Photon for setting up multiplayer  networking and artificial intelligence. Players will have the chance to take part in strategic  battles, experience realistic physics and purchase and customize kites, all set up in  Basant-inspired environments.  The expected product will be a culturally rich game inspired by the festival that will truly  capture the spirit of Basant, bring players together through multiplayer features and  expertly combine tradition with technology. The aim of our project is to produce a vibrant  and engaging multiplayer game that appeals to its users, along with bringing Basant back  to life on a digital platform.",

Our system uses artificial intelligence (AI),  computer vision, and 3D modeling to create a realistic virtual try-on experience. Users  can upload their images, and the system analyzes their gender, age, and skin tone to  recommend the most suitable clothing options. Additionally, it generates a 3D avatar with        Page 636  the user\u2019s face and body shape, allowing them to view a 360-degree preview of how  different outfits will look on them. This helps customers make better purchasing  decisions, reducing the chances of returning products.  The development of this system involves deep learning techniques such as Convolutional  Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and 3D reconstruction algorithms to  create accurate clothing visualizations. Our platform is designed to be accessible across  multiple devices, including mobile applications (Android and iOS), web browsers, and  desktop applications. To ensure a smooth user experience, we have integrated Google  Firebase for database management, TensorFlow for AI-based image processing, and  Three.js for 3D rendering.  This AI-powered marketplace provides benefits to both customers and retailers.  Customers receive personalized recommendations and a virtual fitting experience, making  online shopping more convenient and reliable. Retailers can effectively showcase their  products in 3D, attracting more buyers and reducing return rates. The system also saves  time and effort for shoppers by eliminating the need to visit physical stores.  In conclusion, our project aims to revolutionize the online clothing industry by integrating  AI and 3D technology. By providing a realistic, personalized, and efficient shopping  experience, we bridge the gap between physical and online shopping. This solution  enhances customer satisfaction, improves business operations for retailers, and  contributes to the future of e-commerce.",

FAIZA KHADIM\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: In modern times, the culture of online shopping is increasing exponentially. You can get  everything with just a click. There are so many options that you can get anything,  anywhere, but having too many options is not  always good.  In this  fast-paced   environment, there is no time  for  anyone to track down  all  the desired deals and  discounts available for the specific product they are looking for. Consumers must visit  multiple  online  stores  to  compare  prices,  leading  to  a  fragmented  shopping   experience  and  increased time spent. Furthermore, when shopping for multiple items,  consumers face the challenge of optimizing their shopping list to minimize costs,  including delivery charges. Current online shopping platforms lack the ability to provide  users with personalized recommendations based on their shopping preferences and  behavior. Moreover, they fail to consider the overall cost of the shopping list, including        Page 637  delivery charges, when suggesting products from different stores. As a result, consumers  are forced to spend a significant amount of time and effort to find the best deals, leading  to a frustrating and inefficient online shopping experience. The prices of grocery items,  especially in our country, fluctuate frequently due to discounts, demand, and  promotions.   Keeping  track  of  such  changes  manually  is  almost  impossible.  The  abundance  of  choices available online can overwhelm consumers, making it difficult to quickly find the  best deals and make informed decisions.",

However, there are numerous regions and scenarios where internet connectivity is  unavailable or unreliable, leaving individuals and organizations unable to share critical  information effectively. This digital divide is particularly evident in remote areas, during  natural disasters, and in certain industrial setups where network infrastructure is either  insufficient or impractical. Traditional methods like Bluetooth, NFC, or SMS are often  constrained by proximity, limited range, or lack of automation. Additionally, SMS- based  solutions tend to be insecure and lack mechanisms for data encoding or error correction.  This creates a pressing need for an alternative communication tool that is not only  independent of the internet but also secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Solving this  problem would provide a vital communication bridge, enabling seamless data exchange in  low-connectivity environments, thereby addressing critical gaps in accessibility and  reliability.

Unlike existing  approaches that require full decryption for tamper verification, our system uses Region of  Interest (ROI)- based selective encryption to preserve structural information necessary for  direct anomaly detection on encrypted images. The framework implements a novel  chaotic map for secure ROI encryption while maintaining computational efficiency  suitable for IoT sensors, drones, and embedded systems. The machine learning module  performs pixel-level anomaly detection without requiring full decryption, generating  heatmap visualizations for tampered regions. The system includes secure communication  protocols between Raspberry Pi nodes to demonstrate real- world IoT deployment  scenarios. A Flutter-based interface provides monitoring and visualization capabilities.

      "Project: CAREERQUEST AI: PERCISION GUIDANCE  FOR PAKISTAN'S STUDENT\nAdvisor: MR. ANNAS WASEEM MALIK\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Students often face difficulty in making informed career decisions due to limited access  to professional counselling, fragmented guidance platforms, and the absence of adaptive  learning tools. This leads to poor career alignment, underemployment, and missed  opportunities in higher education. Existing solutions are outdated, scattered across  multiple platforms, or not personalized to the needs of Pakistani students. The proposed  project CareerQuest AI aims to develop a web-based intelligent system that integrates  career recommendations, adaptive test preparation, job market insights, resume building,  and mentorship into a unified platform. The system uses machine learning models for  personalized career suggestions, natural language processing (NLP) for extracting in- demand skills from job postings, and adaptive learning algorithms for test preparation  according to student performance. Core knowledge areas from computer science such as  software engineering, data science, artificial intelligence, web development, and database  systems will be applied to develop the solution. The expected outcome is a centralized  AI-driven platform that demonstrates technical innovation through the integration of  intelligent modules and creates social impact by bridging the gap between academic  learning and job market demands, enabling students in Pakistan to make confident and  future-ready career decisions.",

DANIYAL AHMED\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: In today\u2019s software development world, a lot of time and energy is spent on repetitive  setup tasks instead of actual coding. Developers often have to go through multiple steps  like creating project structures, installing dependencies, setting up servers, connecting  databases, and handling deployments before they can even begin working on the real  product. These steps are important, but they are time-consuming and reduce the focus on        Page 677  creativity and innovation. As a result, developers spend more time preparing the  environment than building useful features.  Our project, One Prompt Web Development,  is designed to make this process easier and faster. It provides an AI-powered platform  where users can create complete MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js)  applications just by giving a simple prompt. The input can be in the form of text, voice, or  even an image. The system understands what the user wants and automatically generates  the project structure and code accordingly. This means users do not need to manually set  up projects or write repetitive code from scratch.  The platform combines all major steps  of web development into one place. It includes a browser-based Integrated Development  Environment (IDE) where users can view and edit their generated projects. The IDE also  provides a real-time preview, allowing users to see live changes as they code.  Additionally, it features a voice-controlled AI assistant that helps users perform actions  through natural speech commands such as generating new components, debugging code,  or managing deployment tasks, making the experience more interactive and efficient.  Users can also connect their projects to GitHub for version control and easily deploy them  to the web with a single click through built-in cloud deployment features.  By automating  the setup, coding, and deployment processes, One Prompt Web Development helps  developers focus more on problem-solving, design, and innovation. It reduces the time  needed to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), supports teamwork through  integrated project management, and lowers the overall cost of development. The platform  can be useful for both beginner and experienced developers who want to quickly create  working prototypes or kickstart new ideas without wasting time on technical setups.  In  simple terms, One Prompt Web Development makes web development faster, simpler,  and smarter. It transforms the traditional way of building applications by allowing  developers to move from an idea to a working prototype with just one prompt. This not  only saves time but also encourages creativity and makes the entire development process  more efficient and accessible to everyone.",

It\u2019s a  smart web application platform that guides users step by step from resume improvement  to technical quizzes and final interviews using Artificial Intelligence. When someone  signs up/logins, their progress is tracked through every stage. First, they upload their  resume, which AI reviews for mistakes like grammar, formatting, or missing details. It  also gives helpful suggestions and offers templates to make resumes look more  professional. Based on this, a resume score is given. If the score is more than 70%, they  are eligible to move on to the quiz stage. The quiz is field-specific, based on user\u2019s  selected area of interest and may cover topics like OOP, DSA, DB, PF. The difficulty  depends on their experience. The quiz is timed, and users can\u2019t switch tabs. If they pass,  they qualify for the final AI interview.

Manual  monitoring of these unindexed, constantly evolving sites is highly inefficient. Traditional  approaches rely on laborious navigation or simple scraping rules, which frequently miss  critical information and cannot keep pace with the dark web\u2019s scale and volatility. To  address this, we propose DarkPulse: an AI-powered autonomous crawler for onion  (.onion) sites that automates the discovery and extraction of leaked data. DarkPulse        Page 681  implements a two-stage machine learning workflow: first it classifies crawled pages as  potential leak repositories or irrelevant content, then it applies natural language  processing to extract structured leak data. The extracted information is stored in a  searchable database. By automating dark web data collection and intelligently filtering  content, our system aims to significantly enhance efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of  leak monitoring. In short, DarkPulse will help security analysts and law enforcement  rapidly identify new data leaks on the dark web, overcoming limitations of manual  methods and basic crawlers. This approach is aligned with the recognized need for  automated monitoring in illicit cyber environments, and promises to deliver more reliable,  up-to-date threat intelligence from onion sites than existing tools.",

JUNAID AZIZ\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: This proposal outlines the development of Auto Munching, an intelligent, mobile-based  application designed to revolutionize customer service in the restaurant industry. The  project addresses the critical problem of operational inefficiency during peak hours,  which leads to long queues, order inaccuracies, and diminished customer satisfaction.  Auto Munch leverages cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language  Processing (NLP) to provide a seamless, voice-activated ordering system. The core of the  project involves creating a conversational AI that can understand natural, free-flowing  speech in multiple languages (English and Urdu) to take customized food orders at drive- thrus, dine-in tables, and front counters. The system will feature a customer-facing mobile  application built with Flutter, a real-time kitchen dashboard, and an administrative portal  for restaurants to manage their unique menus. Expected results include a significant  reduction in service times, improved order accuracy, and an enhanced, modern dining  experience for customers   Introduction and Background The food service industry,  particularly in bustling urban centers, constantly faces the challenge of managing high  customer traffic efficiently. Establishments ranging from local eateries like Biryani  Master to popular brands like Chaman Ice Cream experience bottlenecks during peak  meal times. This often results in overwhelmed staff, leading to human errors in order  taking, longer wait times, and a frustrating customer experience. The conventional  methods of ordering\u2014manual note-taking by waiters or shouting orders across a  counter\u2014are prone to miscommunication and are becoming increasingly outdated in a  technologically advancing world.   While some global chains have experimented with  basic voice prompts or digital kiosks, these solutions often lack the flexibility and natural  interaction that customers desire. They are typically restricted to fixed commands and fail  to handle custom requests or conversational nuances. Auto Munching is motivated by the  need for a more intelligent, adaptable, and accessible solution. By providing an AI-driven  platform that understands natural human language, this project aims to bridge the gap  between technology and hospitality, offering an innovative tool for both small local  businesses and large franchises to streamline their operations and elevate customer        Page 687  service.   Statement of the Problem The primary problem this project addresses is the  operational inefficiency and poor customer experience in restaurants caused by manual  and high-friction ordering processes during peak hours. This core problem manifests in  several ways:   \u2022 Increased Service Times: Long queues form at drive-thrus and counters  as staff struggle to manage simultaneous orders. \u2022 Order Inaccuracy: Miscommunication  between customers and staff leads to incorrect meal preparation and customer  dissatisfaction. \u2022 Staff Overload: Employees are stretched thin, leading to burnout and a  decline in service quality. \u2022 In-Car Ordering Chaos: Customers ordering from their  vehicles are often surrounded by multiple waiters, causing confusion, delays, and a  disorganized service flow.   Objective(s) / Aim(s) / Target(s) The principal objectives of  this project are: 1. To develop an intelligent voice assistant using AI and NLP that can  process natural, conversational food orders, including complex customizations. 2. To  design and implement a cross-platform mobile application for customers to place voice  orders, view menus, and track their requests. 3. To build a web-based kitchen interface  that displays incoming orders in real-time for chefs, ensuring clarity and accuracy. 4. To  create a secure administrative portal allowing restaurant owners to register, upload, and  manage their menus. 5. To integrate a multilingual NLP model capable of understanding  both English and Urdu to cater to a diverse user base.",

UMAR HAMEED\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Page 693  The project CropCountAI is designed to assist farmers, traders, and buyers by providing  an easy way to count fruits and vegetables on trees, evaluate their quality, and estimate  their market price. Traditionally, this process is based on rough guesses, leading to  disputes and unfair deals. Our application replaces this guesswork with a reliable, AI- powered solution that works directly on smartphones. The mobile app, developed using  Android Studio (Java) or Flutter, uses the phone\u2019s camera to capture images of trees. An  AI model, trained in Python using TensorFlow and later converted to TensorFlow Lite,  processes these images to detect, count, and assess the quality of the produce by  considering factors such as size, ripeness, color, and visible damage. The app then  generates an estimated market price based on local rate data. To make the system more  practical, it will also include features like tree health monitoring, pest and disease  detection, multilingual support, offline mode, and a history log of past scans. Along with  the mobile app, a web-based admin panel will be developed. This panel allows  administrators to manage users, update local market rates, and monitor app usage for  better transparency. By combining mobile accessibility with centralized web  management, the system ensures ease of use for farmers while keeping data organized for  administrators. This project aims to provide a low-cost, user-friendly, and transparent  solution that bridges the gap between traditional farming practices and modern  technology, making fruit and vegetable trading more fair, accurate, and efficient.",

The problem it addresses is the lack of  standardized, offline-first, and free resources for learners preparing for Goethe or telc  certifications. Current market apps either hide core features behind paywalls, lack depth  in grammar, or do not align with official exam structures.  The significance of this project  lies in providing an integrated, accessible, and exam-oriented solution for students and  professionals aiming to study, work, or migrate to Germany.

By sourcing CEFR-aligned and unbiased datasets, the app  ensures reliable and standardized content.  Expected results include a fully functional,  offline-first app with synchronized user progress, a fine-tuned AI tutor achieving high  response accuracy, and better learner engagement compared to existing solutions.

ZULKIFL HASAN\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: ReMIND is a web-based application designed to assist individuals experiencing memory  loss disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia. Existing tools depend largely on patient  or caregiver recall and often fail when little or no information is available, leading to  emotional stress and reduced quality of care. ReMIND addresses this gap by integrating  multiple data sources, including text notes, photos, and voice recordings, to reconstruct  daily events in a semi-automated manner. The system employs AI-driven clustering and  reconstruction techniques to transform fragmented inputs into coherent stories and  immersive experiences, supported by reminders and notifications for patients and  caregivers. Built with a lightweight and accessible architecture, the platform is designed  for elderly-friendly use and optimized for low-spec devices common in developing  regions. The outcome is a functional prototype that demonstrates feasibility through  proof-of-concept, showing how AI can bridge emotional gaps, reinforce memory, and  preserve cherished experiences in a secure, user-focused manner.",

ZULKIFL HASAN\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Page 697  The TACT-EVAC project proposes a virtual, AI-driven system for the autonomous  evacuation of high-value military assets (e.g., fighter jets and missile carriers) from  airbases during sudden enemy attacks. The system utilizes a Unity 3D simulation where  virtual cameras, leveraging computer vision (OpenCV/YOLOv8), detect immediate  threats like explosions or obstructions. Upon a "Red Alert," assets are prioritized based on  importance, and dynamic safe paths are computed using A* and Dijkstra pathfinding  algorithms. Virtual robotic vehicles then execute the evacuation by towing assets to the  nearest bunkers. TACT-EVAC serves as a critical proof-of-concept, combining AI,  simulation, and real-time path planning to demonstrate a safer, smarter, and fully  autonomous crisis management workflow for future military readiness.',

MUHAMMAD BASIT ALI GILANI\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Agriculture serves as a fundamental component of numerous economies, but farmers  encounter various obstacles that significantly impact their productivity and profits.  Conventional farming practices depend largely on human knowledge to identify plant  diseases, pest issues, and soil fertility concerns. Sadly, many small-scale farmers cannot  keep up with regular consultations with agricultural specialists. Consequently, diseases  are frequently identified too late, resulting in substantial crop losses.One major concern is  soil deterioration resulting from the ongoing cultivation of the same crop without  adequate rotation. This method exhausts nutrients, diminishes long-term fertility, and  compels farmers to rely on excessive fertilizers, raising costs and damaging the  environment.Many farmers also struggle to access precise weather forecasts specific to  their areas. Sudden changes in weather, such as unexpected rain, extreme heat, or  droughts, can devastate crops within days. Without timely notifications, taking  preventative action becomes nearly impossible. Economically, numerous farmers are  reliant on middlemen who take advantage of them by offering very low prices for their  harvests while selling supplies (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides) at inflated costs. This leads  to an economic disparity, trapping farmers in a cycle of poor profits and substantial debts",

NUMAN ASLAM\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: People often use separate apps to manage tasks and finances, which creates a disconnect.  Task managers focus on productivity but ignore financial impact, while budgeting tools  track expenses but do not consider workload or deadlines. This gap often leads to stress,  missed payments, and poor planning.  The significance of this problem is clear:  productivity and financial health are closely linked, yet most tools fail to combine them.  Our project, TaskNomic, addresses this by offering a single platform for both web and  mobile. Its core feature, the MindFlow engine, adapts to each user\u2019s routine. It analyzes  productivity patterns, balances workload with financial pressure, and detects unusual  changes such as overspending or a sudden drop in task completion.  To achieve this,  TaskNomic uses knowledge areas such as machine learning, natural language processing,  and smart data capture (OCR, voice input, email and SMS parsing). The expected        Page 706  outcome is a system that improves productivity, strengthens financial control, reduces  stress, and helps users maintain a balanced lifestyle.",

Existing productivity and  journaling applications are often too generic, requiring high manual effort and failing to  address ADHD-specific struggles such as unstructured thinking, difficulty in task  initiation, and mood regulation. MindMapMe proposes an AI-powered productivity and  journaling assistant that leverages a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to directly  address these challenges. Users will record quick voice notes, which will be transcribed  into text using a speech-to-text system. The fine-tuned LLM will then convert these  unstructured notes into structured tasks, journals, and mood insights, trained specifically  on ADHD-related data to ensure relevance and accuracy. To improve time management  and reduce cognitive load, the system will integrate with the Google Calendar API,  automatically aligning extracted tasks with schedules. Additionally, the Weather API will  be used to provide context-aware productivity recommendations, acknowledging that  environmental conditions can influence focus and motivation. The outcomes of this  project will include: 1. A fine-tuned LLM model adapted to ADHD-related journaling  and productivity data. 2. A mobile application with an ADHD-friendly interface that  supports voice journaling, smart scheduling, and contextual insights. 3. A research  contribution that demonstrates how domain-specific fine-tuning of LLMs enhances the  usefulness of AI-powered productivity systems for neurodiverse users.

BEENISH ZAFAR\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: In Pakistan and many other countries, personal vehicles are essential for daily commuting  and transport. However, most owners do not follow proper maintenance schedules, often  due to forgetfulness or lack of knowledge. Essential tasks such as oil changes, air filter  replacements, tire checks, brake inspections, and tuning are frequently delayed or  skipped, resulting in poor vehicle performance, increased fuel consumption, unexpected  breakdowns, and higher repair costs. Current solutions like notebooks, spreadsheets, or  third-party apps such as Fuelio offer fuel or expense logging but lack intelligence,  reminders, and local relevance. Most are either too complex for everyday users or  targeted at fleets, leaving a clear gap for a simple, localized, and intelligent mobile app  for individual car and bike owners. To address these gaps, Vehicle Vitals will provide  innovative features alongside basic logs and reminders, including Fuel Cost Prediction to  estimate monthly expenses, a Vehicle Health Score for quick condition insights, an  Odometer Scanner(for digital meters) to reduce manual data entry, and an AI-powered  Chatbot Q&A for common maintenance queries. Additionally, anomaly detection and  visual dashboards will support timely decision-making and efficient vehicle care. The  project will leverage mobile application development (Flutter), backend management  (Laravel + MySQL), AI-based anomaly detection, chatbot integration (Dialogflow), and  data visualization(Graphs etc) to implement the system.

To solve this, we propose  SmartGrade, an automated system that evaluates multiple question types including  descriptive, objective, and numerical problems. The system works with relevant reference  data provided by educators such as model answers, answer keys, and solution steps,  which serve as the benchmark for grading. Using NLP models (BERT), SmartGrade  measures not only the correctness but also the relevance of student responses to the given  question and reference answer. OCR technology further enables the evaluation of  handwritten as well as digital answer sheets. Objective questions are matched against  predefined correct options, while numerical problems are validated against final solutions  with optional stepwise checking. By combining semantic similarity, OCR, and rule-based  evaluation, SmartGrade ensures faster, fairer, and more reliable grading, while still  allowing teacher review where needed.

Most existing safety  apps only respond after an incident has  already occurred which means they are  reactive rather than preventive.  Our project,  SafeHer AI, aims to change that. It is a proactive and intelligent  safety application that  uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict unsafe routes  and prevent possible threats  before they happen. The system analyzes multiple  factors such as crime reports, time of  day, location data, and community  feedback to calculate a Route Safety Score, helping  users make safer travel  decisions.  In an emergency, the app allows users to activate an  SOS alert through voice  command (for example, saying \u201cHelp Me!\u201d). The alert instantly  shares the  user\u2019s live location and audio evidence with her guardians and the nearest   police control room. This direct connection with the police department  ensures  immediate action and quick response.  SafeHer AI also introduces a Campus Safety Mode  for universities, where  students can report incidents, receive real-time alerts from campus  security, and  access verified transport and nearby police contact information. This feature   will help educational institutions improve their internal safety systems and  ensure a safer  environment for female students.  Other features include a Fake Call and Siren option, a  Guardian Circle for  trusted contacts, Community-Based Danger Heatmaps, Anomaly  Detection  for unusual travel behavior, and Discreet Audio/Video Recording for evidence   collection.  With SafeHer AI, we aim to build more than just a mobile app our goal is to   create a reliable and intelligent safety ecosystem that empowers women to  travel freely  and confidently.

Recognized signs are then  translated into spoken words through Text-to-Speech (TTS) and displayed as on-screen  text, enabling seamless communication between deaf/non-verbal individuals and hearing  users. To ensure bi-directional communication, EchoSign also incorporates Speech-to- Text (STT) technology to convert the hearing person\u2019s voice into real-time captions.  Initially, the system will focus on American Sign Language (ASL), with potential  extension to Pakistani Sign Language (PSL/ISL) for local adoption. Key challenges such  as variations in lighting, backgrounds, and hand shapes will be addressed through robust  preprocessing, dataset augmentation, and model optimization techniques. The end product  will be a mobile application that integrates AI-powered sign recognition with real-time  communication tools, offering an inclusive and practical solution for millions of deaf and  mute individuals in Pakistan and worldwide. By combining artificial intelligence,  computer vision, and mobile development, EchoSign aims to bridge the communication  gap and contribute to a more inclusive and accessible society.",

SAMMRA HABIB\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) often suffer from late payments, invoice tampering  and a lack of reliable pre-payment risk assessment. This project proposes a secure,  auditable invoicing platform that combines blockchain immutability (storing invoice  hashes on-chain and maintaining full invoice data off-chain) with an AI-driven risk  calculator that assigns a risk score to each invoice. Smart contracts will automate invoice  lifecycle events (issue, verify, dispute resolution triggers, and conditional release of  funds), while the off-chain database stores full invoice documents and metadata. The  backend (Node.js) will orchestrate blockchain interactions, database operations, and AI  model inference. Frontend dashboards (React) will present clean invoice creation flows,  risk indicators and administrator controls. The system will be containerized (Docker) and  orchestrated with Kubernetes for scalability. Expected outcomes: tamper-evident  invoices, faster dispute resolution, proactive identification of risky invoices, and an easy- to-use platform that improves SMEs\u2019 cash-flow visibility and reduces fraud exposure.",

There are so many white-collar individuals who are needy but can\u2019t ask for        Page 745  help and are too shy to come up to the front. These are people who may appear financially  stable, they might be educated, working low income jobs, or from formerly better off  families, but silently struggle to afford food, clothing, and basic necessities. They have no  one to support them, and because of societal pressure and fear of judgment, they avoid  seeking help to protect their dignity. Helping Hand aims to bridge the gap between  surplus resources and communities in need by leveraging technology for efficient,  respectful, and transparent redistribution. In Pakistan, approximately 40% of food is  wasted annually while 37% of the population faces food insecurity. Alongside, thousands  of tons of wearable clothing are discarded, hospitals struggle with urgent blood shortages,  and many low income individuals or students silently face financial hardships. Current  donation systems are fragmented, manual, or lack real time coordination, leaving  significant gaps in accessibility and dignity for recipients. Helping Hand addresses this by  providing a unified mobile application that integrates food redistribution, clothing  donations, blood donation coordination, and confidential community help requests. Using  geolocation, instant notifications, and smart matching, the system ensures that surplus  resources are directed to verified recipients based on urgency and location. Donors and  organizations are further supported with features such as real time feedback, trust scoring,  flexible donation modes, and event/campaign management for large scale drives. This  project combines concepts from software engineering, mobile app development,  databases, and algorithm design to create a scalable, user-friendly solution. The expected  outcome is a transparent and reliable platform that fosters a circular economy where  surplus resources are effectively utilized, ensuring that every meal, piece of clothing,  blood donation, or financial contribution directly improves lives while maintaining the  dignity of those receiving help.",

Traditional  journaling methods, while beneficial, are passive and do not provide the interactive  support that modern children expect. While some digital platforms offer journaling or  educational activities, they often lack the emotional intelligence, creative stimulation, and  personalization needed to truly engage young minds. Many existing platforms are either  designed for adults or focus narrowly on productivity, failing to create a child-friendly  environment that encourages self-reflection, emotional awareness, and creativity. These  tools typically do not adapt to a child\u2019s emotional state, offer storytelling support, or  provide a sense of companionship that could keep them engaged over time. As a result,  children may lose interest quickly, miss out on valuable opportunities for emotional  development, or never form the habit of healthy self-expression. Additionally, parents and  educators are left without meaningful insights into a child\u2019s emotional well-being or  creative growth unless they are directly involved in every interaction. This lack of  visibility into a child\u2019s mental and emotional patterns makes early support more difficult.

People lack a simple, accessible tool that not only detects their mood but also  offers customized spiritual guidance and actionable insights to help them cope and grow  emotionally. Related Work: Several existing applications provide mood tracking, chatbot  interaction, or spiritual guidance separately. For example, Woebot and Wysa offer AI- driven mental health chatbots that focus on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques but  lack deep spiritual or personalized emotional support. Apps like Calm and Headspace  provide guided meditations and spiritual content but do not use real-time mood detection  or behavioral analysis. Mood tracking apps such as Moodfit and Daylio collect user mood  data and generate reports but usually rely on manual user input rather than automated  behavioral or textual analysis. Most current solutions either focus on mental health  through clinical or meditation approaches or offer mood tracking without combining  these with personalized spiritual advice.",

      "Project: FARMVISION\nAdvisor: MR. UMAR RANA\nStatus: In Process of Completion\nDescription: Agriculture is vital for the economy and food security of many developing  countries, yet  crop yields are severely threatened by plant leaf diseases.  These diseases often go  undetected in rural areas due to limited access to  experts, costly diagnostic tools, and  reliance on subjective manual inspection.  Crops such as tomato, cauliflower, potato, and  cucumber are particularly  vulnerable, and if left untreated, leaf infections can rapidly  spread and cause  major losses.  To address this challenge, the project proposes a CNN- based multi-crop leaf  disease detection system. Unlike traditional methods or single-crop  models, the  system can classify diseases across multiple crops using a dataset of healthy   and diseased leaf images. The trained model is integrated into a web  application,  enabling farmers to upload leaf images, receive instant predictions  with confidence  scores, and access treatment guidance. This approach  provides a low-cost, automated,  and practical solution to support early disease  detection and improve agricultural  productivity.",
